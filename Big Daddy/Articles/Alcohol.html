<p>The official advice from the UK, US, France and even Australia is that women should avoid drinking any alcohol during pregnancy. Yep, we&rsquo;re serious. And don&rsquo;t call us Shirley.</p>
<p>When a pregnant woman drinks alcohol, it passes from the mother&rsquo;s blood straight into the baby. As the baby&rsquo;s liver is one of the very last organs to develop, the baby isn&rsquo;t able to process the alcohol very well. There is evidence that drinking (particularly during the first three months of pregnancy) increases the risk of miscarriage, premature birth, low birth weight and developmental problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fact that drinking heavily during pregnancy (even if it&rsquo;s not regularly) can be extremely harmful for the baby. In some circumstances, babies can develop a serious condition called foetal alcohol syndrome, which leads to facial abnormalities, learning difficulties and restricted growth.</p>
<p>If (mother) has already had a drink or two before she found out she was pregnant, try not to worry. This is incredibly common, and the risk of harm to your baby is extremely low.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As her pregnancy progresses, (mother) may find that she&rsquo;s gone off the taste of alcohol altogether. Either way, a cold glass of tonic with a slice of lime or cucumber can be a surprisingly acceptable alternative to a G&amp;T, or there are plenty of alcohol-free beers and spirits out there. So if you&rsquo;re going to crack open a small batch organic craft IPA on a Friday night, offer her one of these alternatives, or at least make her a cup of tea.</p>
