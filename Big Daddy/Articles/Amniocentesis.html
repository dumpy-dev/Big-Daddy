<p>If (mother) is at risk of having a baby with a genetic condition (e.g. if a higher risk of Down&rsquo;s syndrome was picked up at the dating scan), she may be offered an amniocentesis to check if there is a genetic or chromosomal problem with the baby.</p>
<p>An amniocentesis involves removing a sample of cells from the amniotic fluid using a long, thin needle. It can be a little bit uncomfortable, but isn&rsquo;t usually painful. The test is normally carried out when the mother is 15 to 20 weeks pregnant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The amniocentesis is a fairly safe procedure, but it can cause complications, including miscarriage in 0.5-1% of women. The risk of miscarriage is higher if the test is done before 15 weeks, which is why it is usually carried out several weeks after the dating scan (usually around 12 weeks). This can be a long and agonising wait for parents-to-be.</p>
<p>There is an alternative to an amniocentesis, which is a test called chorionic villus sampling (CVS). This is where the sample of cells are taken from the mother&rsquo;s placenta. The test has a similar risk of miscarriage as an amniocentesis, but it can be carried out from the 11th week of pregnancy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The results of the amniocentesis or CVS will show if the baby has a genetic condition such as Down&rsquo;s, Edwards&rsquo; or Patau&rsquo;s syndrome or if it has a rarer condition. Sadly, most babies with Edwards&rsquo; or Patau&rsquo;s syndrome do not survive. Babies with Down&rsquo;s syndrome can range from having mild learning difficulties to suffering from severe health problems and disability; however, the test cannot tell you the severity of the condition. If the test comes back positive for any genetic condition, you and your partner may face a difficult decision about whether to proceed with the pregnancy.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in this situation, the Down&rsquo;s Syndrome Association has a fantastic website and helpline for parents-to-be: <a href="https://www.downs-syndrome.org.uk/">www.downs-syndrome.org.uk/</a></p>
