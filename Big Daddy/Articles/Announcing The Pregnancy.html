       <p>So the stick has been peed on and the truth is out: she&rsquo;s pregnant! If you don&rsquo;t have a defibrillator in the glove compartment of your Aston Martin, you may need to take a few minutes to remember how to breathe. And then it hits you: you&rsquo;re going to be a dad.</p>
       <p>And then (mother) will probably make you go out and buy enough pregnancy tests to supply a small country of possibly pregnant women. Just so she can be doubly sure. Don&rsquo;t worry - this is normal. Humour her, as much as your bank balance will allow.</p>
       <p>Once you&rsquo;re both satisfied that (mother) is definitely pregnant, and not just feeling the after effects of last night&rsquo;s takeaway, you might feel like you want to shout the news from the rooftops.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
       <p>But before you fire off an yippee-ki-yay WhatsApp message to every contact in your phone book (and we don&rsquo;t mean to put a damper on anything), just bear in mind that around a quarter of pregnancies end in miscarriage during the first three months. Chances are, your little wriggler will be absolutely fine. However, some couples prefer to wait until after the dating scan to tell the world. Others just like to keep their little secret to themselves for a while, to let it sink in. Whenever you decide to share the news, make sure you&rsquo;re both happy and ready to do so.</p>
       <p>When that time comes, you might decide that a phone call or round robin message just won&rsquo;t cut the mustard. If that sounds like you, here are our favourite pregnancy announcements:</p>
       <ol>
           <li>Get a bun and take a photograph of it in the oven. Boom - it&rsquo;s a bun in the oven. If you&rsquo;re feeling creative, you could ice the top with the baby&rsquo;s due date.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></li>
           <li>Give family members a t-shirt or jumper with a hilarious reference to their new role on it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been promoted to Grandma&rdquo; / &ldquo;Uncle to be&rdquo;. You get the idea. This works particularly well if you&rsquo;re making the announcement in a festive season.</li>
           <li>If you have a pet, get them involved! Hang a sign around their neck saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be a big brother/sister!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Promotion to baby guard dog!&rdquo; and take a picture. If they&rsquo;re not compliant, you can always photoshop a speech bubble into the picture instead.</li>
           <li>Line up your shoes, put a tiny pair in the middle and take an arty picture. This only really works if you have nice matching shoes, like Converse or wellies. Don&rsquo;t use her stilettos and your football boots. If you have a shared hobby, you can branch out from shoes and use skis or tennis racquets or golf clubs.</li>
           <li>If you can find a &ldquo;Bump Ahead&rdquo; road sign, you&rsquo;re golden. Get that photo!</li>
       </ol>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>
       <p>One last thing: when you do break the news, do expect the Spanish Inquisition. We guarantee that most people will ask at least one of the following three questions: when is the baby due? How far along is (mother)? Are you going to find out if it&rsquo;s a boy or a girl? Make sure you have both agreed on the answers to these questions in advance. You will thank us.</p>
