<p>The anomaly scan is usually the second scan which women are offered during pregnancy. It normally takes place around 20 weeks.</p>
<p>As dads-to-be are entitled to unpaid time off work to attend two antenatal appointments, it&rsquo;s definitely a good idea to go to the anomaly scan if you possibly can. Not only will you get to see your little wriggler live on camera, but you&rsquo;ll also be able to offer support to (mother) if she&rsquo;s feeling anxious or worried about anything.</p>
<p>During the scan, the sonographer will:</p>
<ul>
    <li>check your baby is developing normally.</li>
    <li>check your baby&rsquo;s bones and organs in detail for any physical problems or abnormalities. This could include issues such as heart defects, cleft lip or spina bifida.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></li>
    <li>tell you the baby&rsquo;s gender, if you&rsquo;d like to find out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></li>
    <li>not change the due date of your baby - this is now set in stone from the dating scan.</li>
    <li>politely laugh when you say, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s looking at you, kid&rdquo; in your best Humphrey Bogart voice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As with the dating scan, there&rsquo;s a very small chance that the sonographer may find that there&rsquo;s something wrong with your baby. If this is the case, (mother) may be offered another test to investigate further. Try not to worry too much about this, as in the vast majority of cases, your kid will be developing perfectly.</p>
<p>At most hospitals, you&rsquo;ll be able to buy copies of the photos from the scan. Don&rsquo;t forget to take cash with you so you don&rsquo;t miss out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>This scan is usually the last opportunity you&rsquo;ll have to see your baby before they&rsquo;re born. Hasta la vista, baby!</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;My husband was unexpectedly sent abroad for work and couldn&rsquo;t come to the anomaly scan, so I took my mum instead. Although we&rsquo;d agreed not to find out the gender of the baby, I couldn&rsquo;t resist! My husband was thrilled to find out that it was a little girl, but I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll trust me and my mum next time around&hellip;!&rdquo; - Portia, Salisbury</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We found out at the anomaly scan that our little baby had a cleft lip. I had been so excited about the scan, but all I could think about from then on was the diagnosis. The hospital team were brilliant, but it overshadowed the whole pregnancy for me. When our little boy was four months old, he had an operation to repair his lip. Five years on, he is such a happy boy and you can barely see the scar on his lip. I wish I hadn&rsquo;t worried so much about the diagnosis at the time - it felt like the worst thing in the world, but it was all fine in the end.&rdquo; - Ash, Leeds</em></p>
