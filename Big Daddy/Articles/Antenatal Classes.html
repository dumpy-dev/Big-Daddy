<p>We know what you&rsquo;re thinking: why on earth would you need to go to an antenatal class when you have the BigDaddy app? Well, they can be a great way to find out (even) more about pregnancy, birth and babies, and you might even make some friends.</p>
<p>Most antenatal classes start around 8-10 weeks before your baby is due, and cover everything from pain relief options during labour to changing a baby&rsquo;s nappy.</p>
<ul>
    <li>NHS antenatal classes are completely free, and run all across the UK. They can book up fast, so make sure you and (mother) ask the midwife or GP about this early on if you&rsquo;re interested.</li>
    <li>NCT classes are probably the most well-known private antenatal classes in the UK. They can be expensive, but the big plus is that everyone is usually keen to stay in touch as a group. Our top tip: if an NCT WhatsApp group is set up, make sure there&rsquo;s a separate one for the ladies and the lads. Not only do the mums tend to send approximately eleventy billion messages during each night feed, but we found we&rsquo;d rather not have an hourly update on little Jack&rsquo;s bowel movements or Kate&rsquo;s latest breast pad mishap. Instead, a separate dads&rsquo; WhatsApp group can be a great place to ask for advice and organise those all-important dad bonding sessions *cough* pub trips.</li>
    <li>If NCT isn&rsquo;t your thing, there are plenty of other private antenatal classes running across the UK. There are even some classes which are just for dads.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></li>
