            <p>If you&rsquo;re the squeamish type who can&rsquo;t sit through an episode of <em>Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy</em> without feeling green, you might prefer to skip this article. Having said that, forewarned is forearmed and we really don&rsquo;t want you fainting in the delivery room.</p>
            <p>An assisted birth is when a midwife or doctor uses forceps or a ventouse suction cup to help deliver a baby. It usually happens because the mum is tired after a long labour, the baby is in an awkward position, or the baby&rsquo;s heart rate has gone a bit funny. Assisted births (AKA instrumental deliveries) are very safe and very common (usually around 1 in 8 births).</p>
            <p>A ventouse cup is a little device which is fitted firmly onto the baby&rsquo;s head, and is attached to a suction device. While the mum is pushing for England, the midwife or doctor will gently pull on the device to help deliver the baby.</p>
            <p>By the beard of Zeus, do we really need to explain what forceps are? They look like a large pair of tongs which fit around the baby&rsquo;s head. The doctor will use the forceps to gently turn the baby (if it&rsquo;s in a difficult position) and help them out into the world. If your baby is born by forceps delivery, you&rsquo;ll never look at a barbecued sausage in the same way again.</p>
            <p>Before an instrumental delivery, the mum-to-be will be given a local anaesthetic (unless they&rsquo;ve already had an epidural), as it can be painful and there&rsquo;s a risk that the skin will tear or need to be cut (AKA an episiotomy). It will either take place in the delivery room, or in an operating theatre. Either way, we&rsquo;d recommend staying up at the head end (unless you have a stomach of iron), under the guise of providing moral support.</p>
            <p>During an assisted birth, there&rsquo;s a small risk that the mum&rsquo;s vagina will tear quite deeply. This is known as a third or fourth degree tear, and can lead to problems with continence (both types). If this happens, whatever you do, DON&rsquo;T make her laugh when she&rsquo;s sitting on your new sofa.</p>
