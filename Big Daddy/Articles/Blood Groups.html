            <p>As you&rsquo;ll know if you&rsquo;ve ever donated blood (and eaten as many Penguin biscuits as you can before the nurse throws you out), all of us belong to one of four main blood groups (or types): A, B, O and AB. Each of these blood types can be either rhesus positive (+) or rhesus negative (-). In the UK, around 85% of us are rhesus positive.</p>
            <p>The most common blood type in the UK is O+. Generally, patients can only receive blood transfusions from people with the same blood group as them. However, superheroes walk among us: those with blood type O- (around 9% of the UK population) are universal blood donors. O- can be donated to anyone, regardless of their blood type.</p>

            <p>Early on in her pregnancy, (mother) will have her blood group confirmed with a simple blood test. It usually doesn&rsquo;t matter at all if a mum-to-be is a different blood type to the dad-to-be. In fact, no one ever even asks what blood group the dad is. We know - how rude.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>However, what does matter is if (mother) is rhesus negative (e.g. her blood type is O- rather than O+).<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            
            <p>If (mother) is rhesus negative and is carrying a rhesus positive baby, there&rsquo;s a risk that her body will think the baby is a foreign invader and produce antibodies to fight against it during pregnancy or birth. This doesn&rsquo;t usually cause problems during a first pregnancy; however, if she was to have another rhesus positive baby in the future, the existing antibodies could then cause that baby to have serious problems such as anaemia, jaundice or even heart failure or brain damage. So it can be pretty serious.</p>
     
            <p>There&rsquo;s a simple way to protect against this risk: if (mother) has rhesus negative blood, she&rsquo;ll be offered a special injection of anti-D at 28 weeks. This injection will prevent there from being any harm caused to your baby as a result of (mother)&rsquo;s blood type.</p>
       
            <p>If (mother) has rhesus negative blood, your baby&rsquo;s blood will be tested straight after birth by taking a sample from the umbilical cord. If the baby&rsquo;s blood group is rhesus positive, (mother) will be given another injection of anti-D. She&rsquo;ll also need to have this injection every time she&rsquo;s pregnant.</p>
  
            <p>There&rsquo;s a small risk that (mother) may already have the antibodies in her system when she becomes pregnant. This will be checked during routine blood tests and, if she does have the antibodies, she won&rsquo;t be offered the anti-D injection. Instead, a specialist will just keep a closer eye on her during pregnancy and make sure that the baby gets any treatment necessary after birth.</p>
           
            <p>If (mother) has rhesus positive blood (and chances are, she does), you don&rsquo;t need to worry about any of this. Go and have a cup of coffee and put your feet up instead.</p>
