            <p>It&rsquo;s alright for women. What with morning sickness, crazy cravings and a bump that&rsquo;s feels like it&rsquo;s the size of an Olympic swimming pool, it can be difficult for mums-to-be to forget that they&rsquo;re having a baby.</p>
            <p>For dads-to-be, their life during the pregnancy doesn&rsquo;t really change all that much. (Apart from the late night trips to the ice cream shop and eye-watering credit card bills for fifty tons of Haribo Tangfastics.) So it&rsquo;s not really a surprise that dads often find it difficult when they&rsquo;re told to &ldquo;bond&rdquo; with the bump.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>On top of this, it&rsquo;s really common for dads-to-be to have worries about being a good dad or how they will cope with the extra cost of the new addition to the family. It might feel easier to put these worries to the back of your mind, but talking it through with a friend (especially if they&rsquo;re a dad who&rsquo;s had a baby recently) might actually help to reassure you.</p>
            <p>The good news is, you&rsquo;re probably already bonding with the bump without even knowing it. From 16 weeks, the baby can hear sounds from outside the womb. Which means that they&rsquo;re listening in on all your conversations with (mother) and learning to recognise the sound of your voice. If you want to, you can sing songs to the bump or read them a book. But don&rsquo;t worry if that&rsquo;s not your thing - you can always subject them to your favourite playlist instead and they may well recognise the music after they&rsquo;re born.</p>
            <p>Try to talk about the baby as much as possible with (mother), and have fun thinking of possible names and wondering what kind of person they&rsquo;re going to be. Make sure you go along to as many of (mother)&rsquo;s scans as you can - seeing your little alien on camera can help everything feel more real. And once the baby starts to kick, ask (mother) to let you know when it&rsquo;s wriggling so that you can feel it for yourself. If they&rsquo;re a champion kicker, try asking (mother) to place an object on her bump and see if they can kick it off. This is a great game, but only if (mother) is in the right mood. Don&rsquo;t attempt without her permission or when she&rsquo;s hungry or you may find yourself sleeping on the sofa.</p>
            <p>But don&rsquo;t stress if you feel like you haven&rsquo;t bonded with the bump. Just by having this app and thinking about how your mini-me is getting on, you&rsquo;re already giving yourself a head start on the road to fatherhood.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
