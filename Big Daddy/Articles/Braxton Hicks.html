            <p>&ldquo;Darling, I think I&rsquo;m having a contraction!&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;OHMYGOD is the bag packed? Did we buy nappies? Do I have time to have a sandwich?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Oh no, wait. Oh. I think it&rsquo;s just a Bloody Hicks.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Braxton Hicks (or Bloody Hicks, as we like to call them) contractions are the fakers of the pregnancy world. They&rsquo;re not real contractions, but are the body&rsquo;s way of practising for the real thing. They don&rsquo;t even mean that labour is imminent. During a Braxton Hicks contraction, a woman&rsquo;s bump will tense up as the womb contracts, and then relax again.</p>
            <p>Braxton Hicks are really, really common. They usually happen during the third trimester, although some women do get them earlier. (mother) may have a couple every day or every hour, or she may not have any at all. Braxton Hicks can be triggered by sex, being active, someone touching the bump or dehydration.</p>
            <p>If (mother) is finding the Braxton Hicks contractions uncomfortable, changing positions can help them to ease off. Alternatively, (mother) could try sipping water or having a relaxing bath.</p>
            <p>Sometimes, it can be difficult to tell the difference between those cheeky fakers and the real thing.</p>
            <p>Braxton Hicks:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Not painful, but can be uncomfortable.</li>
                <li>Irregular.</li>
                <li>Stop after a fairly short time, or a change in position.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Labour contractions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Painful.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></li>
                <li>Regular, getting longer in duration and closer together.</li>
                <li>Don&rsquo;t stop!</li>
                <li>Are often accompanied by other labour signs.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you&rsquo;re not sure if the contractions are real - or if there&rsquo;s something weird and it don&rsquo;t look good - who you gonna call? The midwives! Obvs.</p>
