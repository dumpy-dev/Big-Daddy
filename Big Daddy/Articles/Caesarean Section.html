        A caesarian section (AKA c-section or sunroof delivery) is a surgical procedure to deliver a baby. They are very common - 20-25% of pregnant women in the UK have a c-section. There are two types of c-section:
        
        <p><i>Elective section.</i> This is where the c-section is planned in advance. This might be where the mother has had a c-section before, she has a medical condition (such as gestational diabetes) which means that the baby needs to be delivered before a certain date, the baby is in an awkward position, or she would simply prefer to have a c-section. </p>
        
        <p><i>Emergency section.</i> This covers all non-planned c-sections, and isn’t just limited to blue-light emergency situations! An emergency section might be done where labour isn’t progressing, or where there’s a risk to the mum or baby of delaying the delivery. </p>
        
        <p>A c-section is occasionally carried out under either general anaesthetic (where the mother is completely asleep), but most often it’s done under spinal anaesthetic (where the mother is awake but can’t feel the lower part of her body).
        
        C-sections take place in an operating theatre, with a full team of doctors, anaesthetist and midwives. During the c-section, a screen is placed across the mother’s body so that she (and you!) can’t see what’s happening. Pay no attention to that man (or woman) behind the curtain! The surgeons make a long cut (around 10-20cm) across the mother’s lower tummy and the baby is delivered straight from the womb. It’s an amazingly quick procedure - the whole thing (from numbing to stitching) takes around 40-50 minutes, but the baby is usually out within a few minutes of the first incision.
        
        Provided the mother is having a spinal anaesthetic (rather than a general anaesthetic), her partner is usually allowed to be by her side throughout the operation. Having a c-section can be nerve-wracking (for both parents!) so be sure to hold her hand and offer encouraging words of support throughout. Once the baby has been delivered, she’ll be cleaned up and passed over to her new parents while the mother is being stitched up. Don’t forget to get a photo of you all with you in your surgical gown!
        
        After the c-section, the mother will need to take it easy for a while. She’ll need to stay in hospital for a couple of days and will have pain in her tummy for a week or so. She won’t be allowed to drive or lift anything heavy for six weeks after the operation. </p>
        
        <i><p>“I ended up having an emergency c-section after 36 hours of labour. My temperature went up, and so did the baby’s heart rate, so the doctors told me I might have an infection and that it would be safest to have a c-section. By that point, I just wanted to get the baby out so was very happy to agree! The theatre team were so friendly, and explained everything really clearly. We had our music playing and my partner was holding my hand. It was all so calm. Although I always said that a c-section would be my worst-case scenario, it ended up being the highlight of my labour.” - Harriet, London </p>
            
            <p>“I had a planned c-section as my baby was breech. Even though we knew the exact date she’d be born, nothing prepared me for caring for a newborn whilst recovering from a major operation. My tummy was so sore for the first few days that I struggled to get out of bed without support. My partner was amazing - whenever the baby cried, he would place her in my arms for feeding so that I didn’t have to get up, and brought me endless cups of tea and toast!” - Riya, York</p></i>
