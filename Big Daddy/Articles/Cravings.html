            <p>Picture the scene (it may already be familiar). It&rsquo;s midnight and you&rsquo;ve just crawled between the covers after an evening of Netflix, Sky Sports or Antiques Roadshow (whatever floats your boat). Sleep cannot come soon enough.</p>
            <p><em>(mother): Do you know what I could really eat?</em></p>
            <p><em>You: [Oh god. Please let it be something we have in the house.]</em></p>
            <p><em>(mother): Some really cold melon.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></em></p>
            <p><em>You: [Thank god] No problem! We have a very cold melon in the fridge. I will go and chop it up for you. Anything for a huge but lovely mum-to-be.</em></p>
            <p><em>(mother): But that&rsquo;s a cantaloupe melon in the fridge!</em></p>
            <p><em>You: Is that not a melon?</em></p>
            <p><em>(mother): I just really fancy a honeydew melon.</em></p>
            <p><em>You: [Kill me now] I&rsquo;ll be right back.</em></p>
            <p><em>(mother): While you&rsquo;re out, can you get me some really fresh banana ice cream?</em></p>
            
            <p>Cravings in pregnancy are almost inevitable. Apparently, it has something to do with hormones. In short, (mother) can demand any food she likes until the baby appears and there&rsquo;s not a lot you can do about it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>For your amusement, here are some of the most common pregnancy cravings.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>chocolate</li>
                <li>sweets (particularly sour ones)</li>
                <li>ice cream</li>
                <li>fruit</li>
                <li>pickles</li>
                <li>cheese</li>
                <li>meat (can cause all sorts of problems if she&rsquo;s a veggie)</li>
                <li>spicy food</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&hellip; and some of the weirdest pregnancy cravings we&rsquo;ve heard of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>ice</li>
                <li>heartburn tablets</li>
                <li>mustard</li>
                <li>toothpaste</li>
                <li>dry teabags*</li>
                <li>soap*</li>
                <li>mud*</li>
                <li>chalk*</li>
                <li>coal*</li>
                <li>sand*</li>
                <li>burnt matches*</li>
            </ul>
            <p>*If (mother) wants to eat any of these things (or anything else that is, frankly, inedible or toxic), don&rsquo;t let her do it. She may have an uncommon condition called pica (which comes from the Latin word for magpie - those greedy birds - pica pica), where mums-to-be crave non-food items. It&rsquo;s important that she talks to her midwife about it for advice and support.</p>
            <p>And in case you&rsquo;re wondering, pica has nothing to do with Pikachu (whose name apparently comes from pika, the sound an electric spark makes in Japan, and chu, the sound a Japanese mouse makes).<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
