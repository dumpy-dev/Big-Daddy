            <p>Pop quiz, hotshot. (mother)&rsquo;s contractions have started. You&rsquo;re at home with a half-eaten burrito in front of you. What do you do? WHAT DO YOU DO?</p>
            <p>Well, first things first: don&rsquo;t panic. Secondly, read our incredibly useful guide to the dad&rsquo;s role during labour. Elementary, my dear Watson.</p>
            <p>During the early stages of labour</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Do everything you can to make (mother) feel comfortable. Offer to run her a bath, put on some relaxing music, rub her back and get her something to eat or drink. You&rsquo;re her wingman; make sure she&rsquo;s ready for battle. (But don&rsquo;t call it battle in front of (mother)).</li>
                <li>Don&rsquo;t forget to have something to eat and drink yourself - you don&rsquo;t want to be thinking about your stomach once things start hotting up.</li>
                <li>Time her contractions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></li>
                <li>Call the midwife unit or hospital for advice, if (mother) isn&rsquo;t able to. They might tell you that it&rsquo;s too early to set off, but it&rsquo;s always best to check this.</li>
                <li>STAY CALM AT ALL COSTS. This is definitely the most important thing of all. You need to be I&rsquo;m-so-calm-I-just-swallowed-the-little-book-of-calm-levels-of-calm. Even if you&rsquo;re panicking,(mother) must never suspect a thing. STAY CALM.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The proper stuff</p>
            <p>When her contractions are regular (about five minutes apart) and strong (lasting at least 60 seconds), it&rsquo;s usually time to go into the hospital or maternity unit. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stay calm (see above).</li>
                <li>Call the hospital before you leave, to check they&rsquo;re happy for you to set off. The last thing you want is to be told to go back home!</li>
                <li>Take charge and carry all the bags.</li>
                <li>Make sure (mother) is as comfortable as possible. Help her to change positions or offer her a massage to help her relax and relieve some of the pain.</li>
                <li>Offer (mother) drinks and high-energy snacks regularly to keep her going.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></li>
                <li>Don&rsquo;t forget to eat and drink regularly yourself.</li>
                <li>Offer to sponge (mother)&rsquo;s forehead with a cold, wet flannel.</li>
                <li>Try not to talk during contractions. In between contractions, keep her spirits up by making her smile, and offering encouragement and reassurance. Tell her she&rsquo;s doing an amazing job, you&rsquo;re so proud of her, and you&rsquo;re so excited to meet your baby.</li>
                <li>Encourage (mother) to shout at you, hang onto you, and generally do whatever she wants with you. You will be told that the pain is all your fault. And to be fair, it kind of is. Well, half your fault, anyway. And remember, gentlemen - even if (mother) punches you, don&rsquo;t rise to it. You can&rsquo;t fight in here! This is labour!</li>
                <li>Be (mother)&rsquo;s voice and help her to communicate with the midwives if she needs it. If (mother) is shouting for an epidural, now is not the time to remind her of her natural birth plan. She knows what she wants, so just go with it.</li>
                <li>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask the midwives or doctors questions if there&rsquo;s anything you&rsquo;re not sure about.</li>
                <li>Remind (mother) to go to the toilet every hour.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></li>
                <li>Remind (mother) to breathe steadily. Take a deep breath in and count to three slowly. Then breathe out and count to six slowly. This is a great trick to help both of you stay calm.</li>
                <li>When (mother) is pushing, keep up a steady stream of encouraging words. Think along the lines of: you can do it / you&rsquo;re amazing / keep going / you&rsquo;re doing so well / you&rsquo;re nearly there.</li>
                <li>When she squeezes your hand so hard you&rsquo;re sure it&rsquo;s broken, don&rsquo;t even wince. Definitely don&rsquo;t ask to pop out for an x-ray. You ain&rsquo;t got time to bleed!</li>
                <li>STAY CALM. Do we need to tell you again? If you ever feel like it&rsquo;s getting too much and you can&rsquo;t stay calm, wait until there&rsquo;s a midwife in the room and pop out to the toilet. Take some deep breaths / have a cry / get some fresh air / phone your mum / talk to one of the midwives. Whatever helps. Then put a smile on your face and go back into the room - (mother) and your baby will need you by their side!</li>
