            <p>Despite its name, the dating scan unfortunately doesn&rsquo;t involve a candlelit dinner for two, followed by Netflix and chill&hellip; It&rsquo;s actually an ultrasound scan which (mother) will have when she&rsquo;s around 12 weeks pregnant.</p>
            <p>At the scan, the sonographer will:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>tell you exactly how far along (mother) is and give you a more accurate due date. This could be either earlier or later than the due date you were expecting.</li>
                <li>check how many babies are in there.</li>
                <li>check the baby is growing normally and that there aren&rsquo;t any problems with their development.</li>
                <li>not confirm the gender (it&rsquo;s too early to tell).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>(mother) will be allowed to take someone with her to the scan, so you should go with her if you possibly can. In the UK, dads-to-be are entitled to unpaid time off work to accompany the mum-to-be to up to two antenatal appointments. If you can, you really should go. It&rsquo;s a pretty big moment, seeing your baby on the big screen. &ldquo;Aha,&rdquo; you can say. &ldquo;Look what I&rsquo;ve created. I have made BABY.&rdquo; Nothing beats it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>Before the scan, (mother) will have been offered screening for Down&rsquo;s syndrome. If she agrees to this, she&rsquo;ll have had a blood test before the scan. During the scan, the sonographer will measure the fluid at the back of the baby&rsquo;s neck and will combine the results of both to tell you the likelihood of the baby having Down&rsquo;s syndrome.</p>
            <p>Most hospitals will give you the option of being able to purchase photos from the scan, so don&rsquo;t forget to take some cash along in case they don&rsquo;t accept cards.</p>
            <p>Some mums and dads-to-be can feel a bit anxious about the dating scan, as it&rsquo;s the first time they&rsquo;ll be able to find out if their baby is healthy. Try not to dwell too much on these kind of worries - most scans show a perfectly normal baby (which admittedly will look a little like an alien).<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Seeing your baby for the first time can suddenly make everything seem much more real, and some parents-to-be like to mark the occasion by going out for lunch or getting a takeaway and gazing at the photo of your little alien.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><em>&ldquo;When we went for the dating scan at 12 weeks, I realised that nobody had ever checked that my partner was actually pregnant! All we had to go on was a home pregnancy test, which had been done weeks ago. What if there had been a mistake and there was nothing in there? But when we saw our little wriggler doing somersaults on the screen, it suddenly sunk in - we were having a baby!&rdquo; - Chris, London<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></em></p>
