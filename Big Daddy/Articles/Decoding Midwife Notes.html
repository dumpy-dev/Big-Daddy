            <p>If you&rsquo;ve ever looked at (mother)&rsquo;s maternity notes, you may have felt like you&rsquo;re trying to break the Enigma. After a few pints. Whilst blindfolded. But never fear - we&rsquo;ve got a code breaker right here to help you demystify those notes.</p>
            <p><strong>Baby&rsquo;s heartbeat</strong><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>FH - foetal (baby&rsquo;s) heartbeat</p>
            <p>FHHR - foetal heart heard and regular</p>
            <p>FHNH - foetal heart not heard (don&rsquo;t panic - it probably just means the baby was in an awkward position)</p>
            <p><strong>Baby&rsquo;s movements</strong></p>
            <p>FMF (or just F) - foetal movements felt<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>FMNF (or just NF) - foetal movements not felt</p>
            <p><strong>(mother)&rsquo;s blood pressure</strong></p>
            <p>e.g. 120/70</p>
            <p>The top number (120) is the blood pressure while the heart is beating (systolic blood pressure). The bottom number (70) is the blood pressure while the heart is resting (diastolic blood pressure). 120/70 is the average blood pressure for a woman, but it varies from person to person.</p>
            <p>The midwife or doctor will want to make sure that the bottom figure is not more than 90 and the top figure is not more than 140. It&rsquo;s very common for either number to be high as a one off (usually because we&rsquo;re worrying about it being high!) so the midwife will usually take another reading to check again.</p>
            <p>Oed - swelling (or oedema)</p>
            <p><strong>(mother)&rsquo;s urine sample</strong></p>
            <p>(mother) will have to give a urine sample at every antenatal appointment. She may be stressed about this - trust us, peeing into a pot when you&rsquo;re not a man is much harder than you&rsquo;d imagine. The urine sample is checked for protein, glucose and other things.</p>
            <p>NAD - nothing abnormal detected</p>
            <p>Tr - trace (i.e. a small amount of protein (P), glucose (G) or other (O) has been found - this is very common)</p>
            <p>+, ++, +++ - more than just a trace of of P, G or O has been found, from a little more (+) to a lot more (+++).<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><strong>Baby&rsquo;s position<strong></p>
            <p>Cephalic, ceph, C or Vx - head down</p>
            <p>Br - breech (i.e. bottom down)</p>
            <p>LOA - left occiput anterior (i.e. the back of baby&rsquo;s head is on (mother)&rsquo;s left hand side and towards the front of her tummy)</p>
            <p>ROA - right occiput anterior (i.e the back of baby&rsquo;s head is on (mother)&rsquo;s right hand side and towards the front of her tummy)</p>
            <p>LOP - left occiput posterior (i.e. the back of baby&rsquo;s head is on (mother)&rsquo;s left hand side and towards the back of her tummy)</p>
            <p>ROP - right occiput posterior (i.e. the back of baby&rsquo;s head is on (mother)&rsquo;s right hand side and towards the back of her tummy)</p>
            <p>1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5 - how much of baby&rsquo;s head can be felt above the pelvis (or, oddly, how much of it is in the pelvis - ask the midwife which one it is!)<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>NE or NEng - baby&rsquo;s head is not (yet!) engaged in the pelvis. Once 3/5 of the head is in the pelvis, it is engaged.</p>
