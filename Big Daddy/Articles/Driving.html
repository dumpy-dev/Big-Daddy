            <p>Can women continue to drive during pregnancy? In short, yes - although there may come a time when (mother)'s bump is so big that either her arms won&rsquo;t reach the steering wheel or her feet won&rsquo;t reach the pedals. This might make driving a little more difficult. If this happens, be nice and offer her lifts if you can.</p>
            <p>If (mother) is driving during pregnancy, she should make sure that she:</p>
           <p> <ul>
                <li>wears her seatbelt with the lower strap sitting under her bump and the top strap going over her collarbone. She should avoid lap-only seatbelts as these could be dangerous for the baby if the car brakes suddenly, although any seatbelt is better than none.</li>
                <li>avoids driving for long distances if possible, and takes a break every 90 minutes or so to stretch her legs and keep the blood circulating.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></li>
                <li>stays hydrated in the car and keeps snacks handy.</li>
                <li>gets checked out by a doctor if she has any kind of accident, even if it&rsquo;s really minor and she feels completely fine.</li>
            </ul><\p>
            <p>And contrary to rumour, airbags are completely safe (provided a seatbelt is being used) and will help to protect the woman and her baby.</p>
