            <p>An ectopic pregnancy is when a fertilised egg gets stuck outside of the womb (most often in a fallopian tube, which connects the ovaries to the womb), meaning that it won&rsquo;t develop properly into a baby. Unfortunately, where the pregnancy is ectopic, there is no way to save the embryo and it needs to be removed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>Ectopic pregnancies are uncommon, affecting around 1 in 80 pregnancies.</p>
            <p>Sometimes, there are no symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy beyond a missed period. In these cases, the fact that the pregnancy is ectopic may only be picked up in the first scan.</p>
            <p>If (mother) has pain low down on one side of her tummy, vaginal bleeding or discomfort when going to the toilet, she should contact her GP as it could be a sign of an ectopic pregnancy. If the GP suspects she may have an ectopic pregnancy, he may refer her for a scan or blood tests for diagnosis.</p>
            <p>If there aren&rsquo;t any symptoms, or the symptoms are very mild, the pregnancy may dissolve of its own accord and the woman may not need treatment. Sometimes, the woman may be offered an injection which stops the embryo from growing. In most cases, however, the woman will need surgery to remove the embryo.</p>
            <p>Very occasionally, an ectopic pregnancy can cause the fallopian tube to rupture, resulting in internal bleeding. If this happens, the symptoms are much more obvious and usually include sharp pain in the tummy, dizziness or feeling sick. If (mother) has any of these symptoms, she will need to call an ambulance immediately as a ruptured fallopian tube can be life threatening and requires emergency surgery.</p>
            <p>Having an ectopic pregnancy can feel emotionally very similar to having a miscarriage, and many women and men experience grief for the lost pregnancy. It&rsquo;s really important to communicate with each other about how you&rsquo;re feeling, and seek professional help or counselling if either of you is struggling to cope.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>The positive news is that most women who have had an ectopic pregnancy are able to get pregnant again, although they may need to wait a few months for things to settle down. Be sure to let your GP know as early as possible after a positive pregnancy test so that they can arrange for some early scans to make sure everything is normal.</p>
