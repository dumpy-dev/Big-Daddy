            <p>While (mother) is spending most of the day with her head over the toilet, exercise will probably be<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>the last thing on her mind. In fact, don&rsquo;t even mention the E word at this stage unless you fancy sleeping on the sofa (or worse).</p>
            <p>Once (mother) is feeling better - usually around the second trimester - a little light exercise can be really beneficial for her and the baby. In fact, there&rsquo;s evidence that staying fit can even help avoid problems during later pregnancy and labour. A lot of women find swimming, walking and yoga are all great ways to keep fit during pregnancy.</p>
            <p>Before (mother) deadlifts, have a read of these handy tips to keep her safe while exercising:</p>
            <p>(mother) should:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>keep up her normal level of exercise as long as she feels comfortable</li>
                <li>keep hydrated</li>
                <li>warm up and cool down before and after exercising</li>
                <li>tell her fitness instructor or trainer that she is pregnant</li>
            </ul>
            <p>(mother) shouldn&rsquo;t:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>exhaust herself (she should be able to hold a conversation whilst exercising - otherwise she is probably overdoing it)</li>
                <li>suddenly take up a new and strenuous exercise or sport</li>
                <li>overheat during exercise</li>
                <li>participate in activities with a risk of falling, such as ice hockey or contact sports</li>
                <li>lie flat on her back for long periods after 16 weeks of pregnancy</li>
            </ul>
