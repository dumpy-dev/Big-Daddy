            <p>Apparently newborn babies can&rsquo;t just eat steak and chips, and it&rsquo;s a milk only diet for the first six months or so. We know - not exactly the most varied of menu choices.</p>
            <p>There are three main ways to feed a baby, and you and (mother) can use any combination of these. It&rsquo;s completely up to her and your baby.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><strong>1. Breastfeeding</strong></p>
            <p>Actually, only (mother) can do this one. Sorry chaps. Although if you have man-boobs, watch out - babies have been known to give it a try.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>Breastfeeding can be really hard, especially for first-time mums. They&rsquo;ve never done it before and the baby&rsquo;s never done it before. It&rsquo;s like learning to drive a car when you have no idea where the steering wheel is. And you&rsquo;ve never been in a car before. And the car is crying.</p>
            <p>The official recommendation from the World Health Organisation and Unicef is that &ldquo;breast is best&rdquo;, as breastmilk provides the baby with all the nutrients and protection that they need. Also, breastfeeding is cheap (actually, pretty much free, if you don&rsquo;t count the extra calories (mother) will need to keep her energy up) and - sometimes - easy. There&rsquo;s no faffing around with bottles or sterilisers, and food is almost literally on tap for the baby.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>Having said that, breastfeeding isn&rsquo;t for everyone. Some babies never get the hang of it, and some mums really struggle with it too. If (mother) decides not to breastfeed, or if her body simply can&rsquo;t do it, it&rsquo;s really important that you are understanding and supportive. Regardless of the benefits of breastmilk, the most important thing is that your baby is fed and (mother) is happy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>If (mother) is keen to breastfeed, we&rsquo;d recommend that you buy a breast pump in advance. Even if you just keep it in the package and return it if she doesn&rsquo;t use it. That way, if breastfeeding isn&rsquo;t easy in the early days, she&rsquo;ll be able to express her milk and both of you can bottle feed it to your baby. Just don&rsquo;t forget to sterilise the pump and bottles. If (mother) does struggle with breastfeeding, it&rsquo;s really important that she talks to her midwife to get the support she needs - there may even be breastfeeding cafes in your area where she can drop in and talk to an expert.</p>
            <p>Even if (mother) is adamant that she wants to breastfeed, you might think about buying a ready-made bottle of formula (you can buy ones that even have a teat to attach) and keeping it in the house. Even if (mother) says no, buy it anyway and keep it hidden. Trust us - if you&rsquo;re all crying at 3am because the baby&rsquo;s hungry and they can&rsquo;t work out how to breastfeed, you might all be grateful of an alternative.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Bottle feeding - breastmilk</strong></p>
            <p>See above. Get a pump and you&rsquo;ll be able to help out with bottle feeds. Boom.</p>
            <p><strong>3. Bottle feeding - formula</strong></p>
            <p>Feeding your baby with infant formula - for many families - works brilliantly. We say that whatever keeps (mother) and baby both happy and healthy is the best option for them. There are all sorts of brands to choose from, and you can buy (more expensive) ready-prepared bottles or (cheaper) powdered formula where you just add boiled water.</p>
            <p>If you know you&rsquo;re going to be formula feeding your baby, there&rsquo;s various bits of equipment you can buy to make your life easier - think sterilisers and baby-espresso-machines.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>Try and talk to (mother) before the baby is born to find out what her feeding preferences are. But even if you&rsquo;re desperate to do the night feeds, it&rsquo;s kind of (mother)&rsquo;s call as to how the baby is fed. Just make sure you keep an open mind, and support her with whatever she wants - both before and after the baby is born.</p>
