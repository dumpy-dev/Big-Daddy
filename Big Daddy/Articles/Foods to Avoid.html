<p>Fancy eating liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti? Bad news - liver and alcohol are off the menu for (mother) for now.</p>
<p>Working out what foods (mother) can and can&rsquo;t eat during pregnancy can be a minefield, with conflicting advice making it harder to follow than the Invisible Man. To save you the stress of frantic googling over a restaurant menu, we&rsquo;ve created this handy list of foods for (mother) to enjoy and avoid in the UK:</p>
<p>Eat me:</p>
<ul>
    <li>runny <strong>chicken&rsquo;s eggs</strong>, as long as they have a red lion stamp on their shell. The red lion shows that the eggs have been produced under a strict safety standard and are at very low risk of containing salmonella. So after years of doubt, most runny eggs now have the all-clear. Hurrah.</li>
    <li><strong>mayonnaise</strong>, <strong>mousse</strong> and <strong>souffl&eacute;s</strong>, as long as they have been made with red lion-stamped eggs</li>
    <li>all <strong>hard cheeses</strong>, even if they are unpasteurised. This includes cheddar, swiss cheese, parmesan and stilton.</li>
    <li><strong>pasteurised soft cheese</strong>. This includes mozzarella, cream cheese, ricotta, halloumi, paneer, cottage cheese, hard goat&rsquo;s cheese and feta. Supermarket-bought cheeses are usually pasteurised - it&rsquo;s the restaurant or farm shop stuff you have to watch out for.</li>
    <li>shop bought <strong>yoghurt</strong>. If it&rsquo;s homemade yoghurt, just make sure it&rsquo;s been made with pasteurised milk.</li>
    <li><strong>ice cream</strong>. If it&rsquo;s homemade, just be sure any eggs it contains have the red lion stamp.</li>
    <li><strong>peanuts</strong></li>
    <li>pepperoni, or any other <strong>cooked cured meats</strong></li>
    <li><strong>pre-packed meat</strong> (e.g. ham)</li>
    <li><strong>tuna</strong>, but no more than two steaks or four tins per week as it contains mercury</li>
    <li><strong>oily fish</strong> (such as fresh tuna, mackerel, salmon, trout and herring) but no more than two portions per week as it can contain some harmful pollutants</li>
    <li><strong>white fish</strong></li>
    <li><strong>shellfish</strong></li>
    <li><strong>smoked fish</strong> (including smoked salmon and smoked trout)</li>
    <li><strong>raw wild fish</strong> (such as in <strong>sushi</strong>), as long as it has been previously frozen or if you freeze it for at least four days before using it. Freezing kills any parasitic worms it might contain.</li>
    <li><strong>raw farmed fish</strong>, even if it hasn&rsquo;t been previously frozen</li>
    <li><strong>caffeine</strong>, but no more than 200mg per day. This is the equivalent of two mugs of instant coffee or tea, or a large filter coffee. Cola and chocolate also contain caffeine, so watch out for this.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Avoid:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>runny eggs without the red lion stamp</strong>. Do check when eating out whether they use red lion eggs; if they don&rsquo;t, ask that the eggs be cooked thoroughly as there a risk of salmonella.</li>
    <li>other types of runny eggs, such as <strong>duck eggs</strong>, <strong>goose eggs</strong> and <strong>quail eggs</strong></li>
    <li><strong>soft cheese with white rind</strong>s. This means that <strong>brie</strong>, <strong>camembert</strong> and <strong>soft goat&rsquo;s cheese</strong> are out - unless they have been cooked - as they could contain listeria. Bring on the baked camembert!</li>
    <li><strong>soft blue cheeses</strong>, unless cooked. This rules out gorgonzola, danish blue and roquefort.</li>
    <li><strong>unpasteurised milk</strong></li>
    <li><strong>p&acirc;t&eacute;</strong> (including vegetable p&acirc;t&eacute;), due to the risk of listeria</li>
    <li><strong>raw or undercooked meat</strong>, due to the risk of toxoplasmosis</li>
    <li><strong>cured meats</strong>, again due to the risk of toxoplasmosis, unless they are cooked or you have frozen the meat at home for four days</li>
    <li><strong>liver</strong> (or foods containing liver, such as p&acirc;t&eacute; or haggis) due to its high concentration of vitamin A</li>
    <li><strong>vitamin A</strong> supplements</li>
    <li><strong>game</strong> which has been shot with lead pellets</li>
    <li><strong>shark</strong>, <strong>swordfish</strong> or <strong>marlin</strong></li>
    <li><strong>raw shellfish</strong></li>
    <li><strong>liquorice root</strong> (although liquorice sweets and teas are fine)</li>
    <li><strong>Venezuelan beaver cheese</strong> (no formal guidance available)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>If you&rsquo;re eating outside the UK, don&rsquo;t forget to check the recommendations for pregnant women in that country.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s best not to stuff your face with a brie and swordfish sandwich when (mother) is looking enviously on. As a general rule, have what she&rsquo;s having.</p>
