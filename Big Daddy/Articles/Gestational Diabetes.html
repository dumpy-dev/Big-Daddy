            <p>Pregnancy can be tough. As if carting around a wriggly alien the weight of a prize turkey wasn&rsquo;t enough, many women suffer from tiredness, puffy ankles and more barf-o-rama than Hogan causes in THAT pie eating contest. And they&rsquo;re not allowed to drink! But at least all mums-to-be have the perfect excuse to lie on the sofa and eat as much chocolate, ice cream and pick-n-mix as they like, right?</p>
            <p>Well, errr, no. For the unlucky 5% of pregnant women in the UK who suffer from gestational diabetes, sweet-eating marathons are off the agenda for nine months. And we hate to tell you, chaps, but anyone who tries to deny a pregnant woman of their right to chocolate is in for a rocky ride.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>Diabetes is caused when there is too much sugar in the blood. Some women develop diabetes just during pregnancy, as their body doesn&rsquo;t produce enough insulin (the hormone which controls blood sugar levels) &ndash; this is called gestational diabetes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>Some women are at a higher risk of developing gestational diabetes, e.g. if they:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>are overweight (a BMI of 30+)</li>
                <li>are 35 years or older</li>
                <li>suffer from polycystic ovary syndrome</li>
                <li>previously gave birth to a very large baby (4.5kg+ or 9lb 9oz+)</li>
                <li>previously suffered from gestational diabetes</li>
                <li>have family members who have suffered from diabetes</li>
                <li>have family origins which are South Asian, Middle Eastern or black Caribbean<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p>If (mother) falls into any of the above categories, she&rsquo;ll be offered a glucose tolerance test between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. This involves her having to drink a disgustingly sugary drink, and then having a blood test done afterwards to see how her body copes with it. If her blood sugar levels are too high, she may be diagnosed with gestational diabetes.</p>
            <p>But it&rsquo;s not just women in the above categories who can suffer from gestational diabetes &ndash; in fact, almost 10% of women with gestational diabetes in the UK don&rsquo;t have any of the above risk factors. These women usually won&rsquo;t be offered any screening tests, and so sometimes gestational diabetes can go undiagnosed; however, problems with blood sugar levels can sometimes be picked up during routine urine samples which are done at every antenatal appointment. Other symptoms of gestational diabetes include headaches, blurred vision, needing to pee more often or feeling shaky or thirsty, so do encourage (mother) to tell her GP or midwife if she has any of these symptoms.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>If a pregnant women has very high blood sugar levels, some of this sugar can be passed to their baby. This can cause serious complications, such as macrosomia (where the baby is big), shoulder dystocia (where the baby&rsquo;s shoulder gets stuck during birth), pre-eclampsia, premature birth, or newborn hypoglycaemia (where the baby has low blood sugar). In extreme cases, it can cause miscarriage or stillbirth.</p>
            <p>However, as long as the gestational diabetes is well controlled, the risk to the mother and baby is much reduced.</p>
            <p>Gestational diabetes can be controlled in two ways:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Monitoring blood sugar levels using a home testing kit, and making changes to diet and daily routine to ensure that the levels stay low. If this doesn&rsquo;t work&hellip;</li>
                <li>Taking medication (either tablets or insulin injections) to control blood sugar levels.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Women with gestational diabetes are usually advised to give birth before 41 weeks, or even earlier if their blood sugar levels aren&rsquo;t well controlled. This can mean either having an induction or a c-section.</p>
            <p>Usually, gestational diabetes disappears after the baby is born. However, women who&rsquo;ve had gestational diabetes in pregnancy are more likely to develop it again in future pregnancies and are at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes in their lifetime.</p>
            <p>Being diagnosed with gestational diabetes can be really tough for some women. They might feel daunted by the extra hospital appointments and tests, worried about having a higher risk pregnancy, disappointed that they might not be able to have the natural birth they were hoping for, or even guilty that the whole situation could be their fault for eating that last jelly baby the other night.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>If (mother) is diagnosed with gestational diabetes, be prepared for tears and the fact that chocolate (for once) isn&rsquo;t going to make everything better. Whatever you do, don&rsquo;t google &ldquo;gestational diabetes&rdquo; &ndash; we guarantee you&rsquo;ll scare yourself unnecessarily. Instead, talk to a medical professional and have a read of these tips to help the two of you get your heads around the diagnosis:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>give (mother) a big hug (or as big as you can manage with that enormous bump in between you) and let her know you&rsquo;re there to talk whenever she&rsquo;s ready.</li>
                <li>run (mother) a warm bath with her favourite bubbles or a few drops of lavender oil, put some music on and suggest that she soaks for long as she likes with a magazine or book.</li>
                <li>if (mother) has been advised to increase her activity levels, suggest that you have a regular date night where you do something active together, such as a long walk, swimming or even yoga.</li>
                <li>have a look at <a href="http://www.gestationaldiabetes.co.uk">www.gestationaldiabetes.co.uk</a>. It&rsquo;s a fantastic website with loads of information and support for mums and dads.</li>
                <li>have a read of some recipes for gestational diabetes-friendly meals and snacks and put your chef&rsquo;s hat on. Bringing (mother) a cup of a tea and a tasty treat might help to make her smile again.</li>

            <p><em>&ldquo;I was 32 weeks pregnant when a routine urine sample showed that my sugar levels were high. I was referred to the diabetes team and - after a week of pricking my fingers after meals to test my blood sugar levels - was told that I had gestational diabetes. I was devastated. I was underweight before I got pregnant, so it was the last thing I expected. I managed to control my blood sugar levels through careful eating throughout the rest of my pregnancy, and had an uncomplicated birth. But the best thing of all (apart from meeting our son!) was being able to eat as much toast and jam as I liked after the birth!&rdquo; - Emma, London</em></p>
