            <p>It&rsquo;s obvious, right? Everyone knows that the way to find out the gender of your baby is for the mum-to-be to wee on a glowworm by the light of a full moon. If the glowworm turns purple, it&rsquo;s a girl. If it turns orange, it&rsquo;s a boy.</p>
            <p>Of course don&rsquo;t do this (even if you can find a glowworm). Instead, here are our vegan-friendly old-wives&rsquo; tales to predict the gender of your baby. Because it&rsquo;s just way too obvious to ask the sonographer at the 20 week scan.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Dangle a ring over (mother)&rsquo;s bump while she&rsquo;s lying down. If the ring swings in circles, it&rsquo;s a girl. If it swings backwards and forwards like a pendulum then it&rsquo;s a boy. Get swinging!</li>
                <li>If (mother) is craving sweet things, she&rsquo;s having a girl. If it&rsquo;s saltiness all the way, it&rsquo;s a boy.</li>
                <li>If (mother)&rsquo;s morning sickness is particularly bad, it&rsquo;s a girl.</li>
                <li>If (mother)&rsquo;s face is glowing like an advert for the latest miracle cream, it&rsquo;s a boy.</li>
                <li>Is (mother) more moody or chilled out than usual? Moodiness means it&rsquo;s a girl!</li>
                <li>Look at (mother)&rsquo;s bump. If it&rsquo;s high up, it&rsquo;s a girl. If it&rsquo;s low down, it&rsquo;s a boy.</li>
                <li>In (mother)&rsquo;s next antenatal appointment, make a note of the baby&rsquo;s heart rate. If it&rsquo;s over 140 beats per minute, it&rsquo;s a girl.</li>
                <li>Ask (mother) to get you a beer from the fridge. If she takes the first step with her right foot, it&rsquo;s a boy. Either way, you&rsquo;ve got a beer. Boom.</li>
                <li>Get in your DeLorean and go back to 26 weeks before the night that got you into this whole situation. The higher (mother)&rsquo;s blood pressure on this date, the more likely it is that it&rsquo;s a boy. What are you waiting for? <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></li>
                <li>Ask (mother). Research shows that over 75% of women can accurately guess the sex of their baby. So if she has a hunch, chances are she&rsquo;s right!<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></li>
