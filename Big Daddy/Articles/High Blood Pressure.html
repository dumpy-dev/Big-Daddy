            <p>(mother) will have her blood pressure checked at every antenatal appointment.</p>
            <p>A normal blood pressure reading will be around 120 over 70 (also written as 120/70). The first number (120) is the systolic blood pressure, and the second number (70) is the diastolic blood pressure.</p>
            <p>In pregnancy, high blood pressure (hypertension) is where the systolic blood pressure is over 140 or the diastolic blood pressure is over 90.</p>
            <p>It&rsquo;s very common to have &ldquo;white coat&rdquo; hypertension, which is where blood pressure rises because we are worried about having a high reading. If (mother) gets a high reading, the midwife or GP will very likely repeat the test straight away. If the GP looks like George Clooney, they may repeat it twice. Jokes. It may help if (mother) just takes a few deep breaths to relax, and tries to think about something else. Not George Clooney.</p>
            <p>If a consistently high reading is obtained, it may be investigated as it could be a sign of a condition called pre-eclampsia. Alternatively, some women simply have slightly raised blood pressure during pregnancy and may need to take medication. In addition to this, it has been found that keeping active and eating a healthy diet (with low salt intake) can help to lower blood pressure. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>If (mother) had high blood pressure before she became pregnant, she should speak to her GP as soon as she can, as some medications for high blood pressure aren&rsquo;t safe to take during pregnancy.</p>
