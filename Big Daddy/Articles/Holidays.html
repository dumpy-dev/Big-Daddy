            <p>Looking for a way to celebrate reaching the end of the first trimester, with its sickness, tiredness and unexpected mood swings? The second trimester is the perfect time to go on holiday, when (mother) is feeling at her best and isn&rsquo;t so big that they&rsquo;ll need to redistribute the weight on the plane.</p>
            <p><strong>Flying</strong></p>
            <p>The good news is, flying is totally safe during pregnancy. Most airlines won&rsquo;t let pregnant women travel after around 34 weeks, so (mother) may require a doctor&rsquo;s letter confirming the due date. Make sure you check this with the airline before booking.</p>
            <p>There&rsquo;s a slightly increased risk of (mother) getting a deep vein thrombosis on long haul flights, but the risk is still low. Pick up a pair of compression stockings to reduce the risk further.</p>
            <p><strong>Insurance</strong></p>            <p>Make sure you let your travel insurance company know that (mother) is pregnant. They&rsquo;re unlikely to provide cover if you&rsquo;re travelling within 8 weeks of the due date, but any time before then is usually fine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><strong>Sunshine</strong></p>
            <p>Whilst it&rsquo;s a great idea for (mother) to top up her vitamin D, her skin will be more sensitive than usual to the sun. Remind her to cover up, use plenty of suncream and stay out of the midday sun to avoid sunburn.</p>
            <p><strong>Illness</strong></p>
            <p>Dehydration can be dangerous for (mother) and the baby, so take extra care when you&rsquo;re eating and drinking abroad. It&rsquo;s usually best to stick to bottled water, unless you&rsquo;re 100% sure it&rsquo;s safe. If (mother) does come down with a sickness bug or food poisoning, check that any medicines she wants to take are safe for use during pregnancy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>If (mother) is prone to feeling queasy on the move, be aware that morning sickness can make travel sickness worse.</p>
            <p><strong>Vaccinations</strong></p>
            <p>This is a bit of a complicated topic, but some vaccinations aren&rsquo;t safe during pregnancy. Check with your doctor or nurse whether you&rsquo;ll need vaccinations or anti-malarial tablets, and whether (mother) can take them. However, given the possible risks, it might be best to reschedule that exotic getaway for a few years after (baby) is born.</p>
            <p><strong>Activities</strong></p>
            <p>Thinking of freediving, wing-suiting or heliskiing? Fancy trying cave diving or high-altitude mountaineering? Sadly, anything with a risk of falls or over-exertion is off limits for (mother), so that rules out horse riding, skiing (on snow and water) and scuba diving too.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
