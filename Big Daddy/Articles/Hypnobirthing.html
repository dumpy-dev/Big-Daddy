            <p>Hypnobirthing is a method of pain management which some women like to use during labour. With its combination of breathing exercises, relaxation, visualisation and mindfulness techniques, hypnobirthing can help some women to cope with the pain of labour.</p>
            <p>Although limited research has been done into it, there&rsquo;s some evidence which suggests that hypnobirthing can be an effective way to manage pain during labour. And you don&rsquo;t even need Derren Brown to be there to give it a go.</p>
            <p>(mother) and you can start by practising some simple breathing exercises. Set aside a bit of time every day if you can. Breathe in deeply and slowly through your nose and out of your mouth. Count slowly to three as you breathe in, and then count to six as you breathe out. When you breathe out, try visualising blowing a golden thread gently out in front of you to keep the breath nice and steady. Controlled breathing can help to lower the heart rate and keep (mother) calm. It&rsquo;s important that you practise these breathing exercises together, as you&rsquo;ll be able to help (mother) during labour to focus on her breathing. Once you&rsquo;re both feeling relaxed, channel Morgan Freeman and try reading our hypnobirthing script aloud in your most soothing voice.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>However (mother) feels about pain relief during labour, there&rsquo;s no doubt that staying calm will help her to get through the experience (and may reduce the risk of you being punched in the nose at some point during labour - although that&rsquo;s not guaranteed).</p>
            <p>If you&rsquo;re interested in finding out more about hypnobirthing, you can sign up for NHS or privately run classes in your local area. Alternatively, there are plenty of books and CDs available to take you through hypnobirthing in detail.</p>
