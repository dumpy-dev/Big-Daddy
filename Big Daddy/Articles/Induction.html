            <p>Have you ever imagined how you might find out that (mother) is in labour? Some dads-to-be get an unexpected phone call during a crucial work meeting. Some are awoken by a shriek of, &ldquo;Either I&rsquo;ve wet the bed or my waters have broken!&rdquo; And others are in hospital already, bouncing around on a ball and waiting for something to happen.</p>
            <p>It&rsquo;s official: induction tops the list of the most underwhelming starts to labour in the world. It&rsquo;s the birthing equivalent of watching darts online. With a slow wi-fi connection. While waiting for the boiler repairman to show up.</p>
            <p>Induction (or being induced) is the process of artificially starting labour, and it&rsquo;s really common: around 20% of pregnant women end up having an induction. The most frequent reasons for being induced are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>being &ldquo;overdue&rdquo; (i.e. the mother has been pregnant for almost 42 weeks and is a bit fed up. Fair dos, really)</li>
                <li>the mother&rsquo;s waters have broken but 24 hours have passed and the lazy baby hasn&rsquo;t shown signs of making an appearance</li>
                <li>there is some risk to the mother or baby (such as gestational diabetes or high blood pressure) which means it&rsquo;s best to get the baby out</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Inductions are always planned in advance, so there&rsquo;s plenty of opportunity for mums and dads-to-be to ask any questions about the procedure. And as with any medical procedure, there&rsquo;s no obligation to agree to it.</p>
            <p>Induction can be a bit of a long (boring) process:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Before induction starts, the mother is offered a membrane sweep. This is when the midwife or doctor sweeps their finger around the mother&rsquo;s cervix to try and separate the membranes of the amniotic sac. If the baby isn&rsquo;t ready yet, the mother&rsquo;s cervix won&rsquo;t be in the right position and the doctor or midwife won&rsquo;t be able to do the sweep. Sometimes, labour starts naturally after a sweep. If it doesn&rsquo;t, she may be offered a full induction of labour.</li>
            </ol>
            <ol start="2">
                <li>Inductions take place in the maternity unit of a hospital. A midwife will insert a pessary or gel into the mother&rsquo;s vagina. This contains the hormone prostaglandin, which can stimulate contractions and trigger labour. Sometimes, parents are allowed to go home after the initial pessary has been inserted, but it depends on the hospital and individual circumstances.</li>
            </ol>
            <ol start="3">
                <li>If nothing happens, the mother may be offered another pessary.</li>
            </ol>
            <ol start="4">
                <li>If contractions start but labour is progressing slowly, the mother may be offered a hormone drip (which contains syntocinon, a synthetic form of the hormone oxytocin) to speed it up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></li>
            </ol>
            <ol start="5">
                <li>It can take 24-48 hours for labour to start, but once it does it should proceed normally. If induction just doesn&rsquo;t work, the mother may be offered a caesarian section.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, induced labour can be more painful than a labour that starts naturally (but best not to shout about this). Just bring lots of snacks, magazines and things to do and prepare to meet your baby.</p>
            <p><em>&ldquo;I was induced at 42 weeks. We&rsquo;d heard that walking after being given the pessary can help bring on labour, so we walked miles all around the hospital and up and down every staircase I could find. It must have worked, as my waters broke 12 hours later!&rdquo; - Julia, Leeds</em></p>
            <p><em>&ldquo;My wife was induced at 40 weeks as she had gestational diabetes. We waited for two whole days (and two lots of pessaries) but nothing happened. Luckily, I had downloaded the entire series of </em>Lost<em> for us to watch so it wasn&rsquo;t too bad! After 48 hours, the doctors told us that they would advise a c-section, and our gorgeous little girl was with us hours later.&rdquo; - Mo, Hull</em></p>
