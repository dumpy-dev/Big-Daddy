            <p>The days of anxiously pacing the hospital corridors and trying to ignore the sounds of the labour ward are gone. Nowadays, dads-to-be are usually expected to be at the mother&rsquo;s side throughout labour. So you chaps should probably know what to expect. But we&rsquo;ll keep this brief, as you don&rsquo;t need all the gory details.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>Like the musketeers, Lions and components of a BLT, there are three stages of labour:</p>
            
            <p><strong>1. The first stage</strong></p>
            <p>Contractions begin and the mum&rsquo;s cervix will start to open (dilate). You (or (mother)) will need to call the midwife and get their advice on what to do next. Fasten your seatbelts - it&rsquo;s going to be a bumpy ride. During this stage, you&rsquo;ll travel to wherever you plan to have the baby and things will really start to heat up. This tends to be the longest stage of labour, but you ain&rsquo;t heard nothing yet.</p>
            <p><strong>2. The second stage</strong></p>
            <p>Once (mother)&rsquo;s cervix is 10cm dilated (and the pain is at eleven), the second stage begins. There might be a short breather, but just when you think you&rsquo;re out, they pull you back in. *SPOILER ALERT* It&rsquo;s time for her to push and deliver the baby.</p>
            <p><strong>3. The third stage</strong></p>
            <p>Once the baby is born, the third stage begins. (mother)&rsquo;s contractions will start up again and she will deliver the placenta. She can opt to have an injection to speed this up.</p>
            <p>The fourth stage is obviously the tea and toast, and cuddles with your baby, but apparently that&rsquo;s not technically an official term. Yet.</p>
