            <p>Sadly, miscarriages (where a baby is lost during the first 23 weeks of pregnancy) are common. On average, one in six pregnancies will end in miscarriage. Of these, 75% happen within the first 12 weeks.</p>
            <p>The cause of miscarriage isn&rsquo;t usually known, but it&rsquo;s thought to be most often caused by a problem with the development of the foetus. Some women are more at risk of having a miscarriage than others. Risk factors include age (being over 35), smoking, drinking, drug-taking, caffeine intake and obesity. However, in most cases, the mother has not done anything to cause the miscarriage.</p>
            <p>It&rsquo;s important that you know the symptoms of miscarriage, so that you&rsquo;re able to recognise the situation and act quickly to help.</p>
            <p>Most often, the main sign of a miscarriage is vaginal bleeding and pain or cramping in the lower tummy. If (mother) says she&rsquo;s bleeding, don&rsquo;t panic - light bleeding is actually quite common during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, and isn&rsquo;t necessarily bad news. The most important thing is to make sure that (mother) rings up her GP or maternity unit as soon as possible for medical advice.</p>
            <p>If she has symptoms of a miscarriage, the mother will usually be offered tests and an ultrasound to work out what&rsquo;s going on. If a miscarriage is confirmed, the pregnancy tissue will either pass out of the mother&rsquo;s body naturally, or she&rsquo;ll be offered medication or surgery to help remove it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>After having a miscarriage, the woman should avoid having sex until all of her symptoms have disappeared. It may take several months for her cycle to return to normal, but she should make sure she uses contraception immediately if she doesn&rsquo;t want to get pregnant.</p>
            <p>Having a miscarriage can be very upsetting for you and your partner. Some people feel the emotional impact of a miscarriage right away, and for others it may take longer to sink in. People need to grieve at their own pace and it may be a while before they are ready to think about another pregnancy. The most important thing is to communicate with each other, and to access counselling or support services through your GP if either of you is struggling to cope. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>The good news is that recurrent miscarriages (losing more than three pregnancies in a row) only affects around 1% of women. So if and when you&rsquo;re ready to start trying again, there&rsquo;s every reason to be optimistic.</p>
