            <p>Morning sickness is so common that, chances are, (mother) will feel sick sometime during her first trimester. It affects around 70-80% of pregnant women, and ranges from occasional bouts of green-tinged nausea to full-on vomathons.</p>
            <p>Despite the name, morning sickness can strike at any time of day. However, it usually clears up by around 16-20 weeks of pregnancy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>A few very unlucky women suffer from a rare type of morning sickness called hypermeresis gravidarum (made famous by Princess Kate), which may require urgent hospital treatment. If (mother) is so sick that she&rsquo;s unable to keep any food or drink down, she should contact her GP or midwife immediately as there&rsquo;s a risk she could become malnourished or dehydrated.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>If (mother) is feeling queasy, here are a few things she can try to ease the symptoms:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>eat small, frequent meals which aren&rsquo;t too greasy. Rice, pasta, crackers and bread are ideal.</li>
                <li>cold meals (as opposed to hot ones) may appeal more.</li>
                <li>avoid strong smelling foods.</li>
                <li>drink plenty of water, but don&rsquo;t gulp it down. Small sips are the way forwards. Some women swear by carbonated water to settle the stomach.</li>
                <li>try adding some chopped fresh ginger to a mug of hot water to create your own ginger tea.</li>
                <li>get lots of rest. Feeling tired can make nausea worse.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>If the sickness just doesn&rsquo;t go away, or is making (mother)&rsquo;s life really difficult, the GP may be able to prescribe anti-sickness tablets. In the meantime, it&rsquo;s your job to make sure (mother) puts her feet up, leave any smelly shoes outside the door and bring her pieces of toast which she may or may not fling on the floor. See it as nature&rsquo;s way of preparing you for mealtimes with a messy toddler.</p>
            <p><em>&ldquo;A couple of weeks after we found out that my wife was pregnant, we had a celebratory night in. My wife lit her favourite scented candle and we cooked an incredible Indian curry feast. The next day, morning sickness hit her like a ton of bricks. She made me throw away the scented candle and banned anything that smelled or tasted of curry for the next seven months!&rdquo; - Nic, London</em></p>
