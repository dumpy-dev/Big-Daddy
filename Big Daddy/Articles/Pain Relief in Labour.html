            <p>We&rsquo;re not going to lie; childbirth can be painful. For both parents-to-be. But to help reduce the risk of you having your fingers broken, here&rsquo;s a list of the most commonly used pain relief options in labour:</p>
            <p><strong>Epidural</strong></p>
            <p>The big daddy of painkillers. An epidural is a local anaesthetic which is injected into the spine by an anaesthetist and numbs the lower part of the mother&rsquo;s body, so they usually don&rsquo;t feel any pain at all. The mother will also usually be given fluids via a drip in her arm - this helps to maintain a good blood pressure. Once the epidural is in place, it can be topped up as needed. The baby&rsquo;s heart rate will need to be monitored continuously if the mother is having an epidural. Most women can&rsquo;t move around while an epidural is in place, but some hospitals are able to offer a &lsquo;mobile&rsquo; epidural.</p>
            <p>There is evidence that having an epidural can prolong labour, and can increase the risk of having an instrumental delivery, but they are generally very safe and provide amazingly effective pain relief.</p>
            <p><strong>Pethidine injections</strong></p>
            <p>When pethidine is injected into the mother&rsquo;s leg, it eases the pain and can help her to relax. It usually lasts around two to four hours. Pethidine can make some women feel a bit nauseous or dizzy, and it won&rsquo;t be able to be given too close to the actual birth as it can affect the baby&rsquo;s breathing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><strong>Gas and air (Entonox)</strong></p>
            <p>Gas and air is a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide gas, which the mother can breathe in through a mask or mouthpiece. It can make some women feel light-headed or nauseous, but many women find it&rsquo;s a great way to help reduce and control the pain. It usually takes about 15-20 seconds for the gas to kick in, so it&rsquo;s best to breathe it in slowly and deeply just as a contraction begins.</p>
            <p><strong>TENS machine</strong></p>
            <p>A TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) machine can help ease lower back pain during the early stages of labour. Electrodes are taped onto the mother&rsquo;s back (TENS machines usually come with replaceable sticky pads which are easy to use) and connected to a small hand-held machine by wires. The mother can hold the machine and send small amounts of electrical current in pulses to her back. This helps the body to release endorphins and can reduce pain. There aren&rsquo;t any known side effects, but some women find it doesn&rsquo;t help as much once labour is in full swing. Some hospitals have TENS machines, but many don&rsquo;t, so you might need to borrow, hire, or buy your own if (mother) would like to try it out.</p>
            <p><strong>Water</strong></p>
            <p>Yep, that&rsquo;s right - having a nice warm bath can help reduce pain in labour. Some hospitals and maternity units have birthing pools available for use during labour, but they are usually only suitable for women who have had very straightforward pregnancies. If a mother has had an epidural, she usually won&rsquo;t be able to use the pool. Don&rsquo;t forget, even if you know that (mother) won&rsquo;t be able to (or would prefer not to) use a birthing pool, having a warm bath at home in the very early stages of labour can be a great way to relax through those first contractions.</p>
            <p><strong>Complementary and alternative medicines</strong></p>
            <p>Some women swear by aromatherapy oils (such as clary sage) to strengthen contractions, or massage or hypnotherapy to relax during labour. The NHS don&rsquo;t offer these kinds of pain relief options, but if you and (mother) feel that you want to give it a try, it&rsquo;s easy to find what you need in health food shops or online.</p>

            <p><em>&ldquo;My partner was adamant throughout her pregnancy that she wanted a completely natural birth. She told me that if she asked for an epidural I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to let her - even if she begged. She ended up having a long and difficult labour and insisted that she did actually want an epidural. I didn&rsquo;t know what to do! She had the epidural and said afterwards that it was the best decision she made. Phew!&rdquo; - Patrick, Edinburgh</em></p>
