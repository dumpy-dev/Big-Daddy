            <p>If you didn&rsquo;t already need the perfect excuse for a bit of time off work, there is plenty of evidence that taking paternity leave (or even just annual leave) after having a baby has a really positive impact on the whole family. Studies have shown that where dads take paternity leave:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>they are more hands-on dads in general</li>
                <li>they are less likely to have alcohol-related problems or die early</li>
                <li>their relationship with their baby&rsquo;s mum is better</li>
                <li>their baby&rsquo;s development is improved</li>
                <li>their baby&rsquo;s mum has a reduced rate of illness and postnatal depression</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In the UK, eligible dads are entitled to take up to two weeks of paternity leave. This is paid at &pound;145.18, or 90% of your average earnings (whichever is lower). To be eligible, you must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>actually be the dad or partner of the mum-to-be (this includes adopting). Your employer may get suspicious if this is your fifth paternity leave in three months. Just saying.</li>
                <li>be in employment and earning at least &pound;113 per week (before tax)</li>
                <li>have worked for your employer for 26 weeks before the end of the 15th week before the baby is due</li>
                <li>at least 15 weeks before the baby is due, tell your employer the due date and when you want the leave to start. They don&rsquo;t expect you to be psychic - you can just say you want it to start whenever the baby comes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>If you work for a jammy company, they might give you more paternity leave or top up the paternity pay. This is the holy grail. Make the most of it.</p>
            <p>Dads can also take unpaid leave to accompany mums-to-be to two antenatal appointments. Again, they have to be your actual partner or the mother of your child, not just Molly-next-door who fancies a day out with you.</p>
            <p>If you want a bit of time as a stay-at-home dad (or if (mother) is keen to get back to work), you might want to look into sharing parental leave. This is where you can share up to 50 weeks of leave and up to 37 weeks of statutory pay between you. You can either take the leave at the same time, or stagger it between you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>For more info on paternity leave in the UK, have a look at the government&rsquo;s website: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/paternity-pay-leave">https://www.gov.uk/paternity-pay-leave</a></p>
            <p>If you&rsquo;re not eligible for paternity leave, don&rsquo;t panic - you can still take annual leave around the time the baby is born. It&rsquo;s a life-changing time, and (mother) will need all the support, hugs, cups of tea and punch bags she can get. You won&rsquo;t regret it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
