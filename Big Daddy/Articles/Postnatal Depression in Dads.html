            <p>Did you know that postnatal depression can also affect dads, as well as mums? Studies have shown that more than 1 in 3 new fathers have concerns about their own mental health, and 1 in 10 suffer from postnatal depression.</p>
            <p>Becoming a dad (whether it&rsquo;s for the first time or the fifth) can be a stressful and emotional time. Even though you may be completely in love with your tiny (but very stinky and screamy) bundle, there&rsquo;s no denying that your lifestyle and relationship will change overnight. What with sleep deprivation, possible financial worries, and feelings of sadness or guilt at returning to work, it&rsquo;s not really surprising that having a baby can have a significant impact on dads&rsquo; mental health.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>The symptoms of postnatal depression are varied, and can include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Feeling very low</li>
                <li>Feeling like you don&rsquo;t want to do anything, or avoiding friends</li>
                <li>Feeling like you can&rsquo;t cope</li>
                <li>Feeling guilty about not being a &lsquo;good enough&rsquo; dad or not loving your baby enough</li>
                <li>Wanting to cry</li>
                <li>Problems sleeping or vivid nightmares</li>
                <li>Panic attacks</li>
                <li>Comfort eating or loss of appetite</li>
                <li>Problems concentrating</li>
                <li>Overwhelming anxiety about things that wouldn&rsquo;t normally bother you</li>
                <li>Obsessing about your baby&rsquo;s health or safety</li>
                <li>Disturbing thoughts about harming yourself or your baby</li>
                <li>Thinking about death</li>
            </ul>
            <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
            <p>It&rsquo;s so important to remember that low mood and anxiety is incredibly common in new parents, and doesn&rsquo;t mean that you have postnatal depression. If you&rsquo;re feeling a bit low, try and get out and take some exercise or meet up with a friend or family member and do something you enjoy (ideally with the baby!). If you know any other dads, perhaps suggest going for a walk with the buggies and try and open up to them about how you&rsquo;re feeling. It might seem like the hardest thing in the world, but chances are they&rsquo;ve felt the same way.</p>
            <p>If you&rsquo;re worried that your low mood isn&rsquo;t going away, or if you just don&rsquo;t feel &lsquo;right&rsquo; in yourself, you should get in touch with your GP right away as there might be other options which could help. If you ever feel like you&rsquo;d like to talk to someone - even if it&rsquo;s in the middle of the night - you can always call The Samaritans&rsquo; 24 hour helpline on 116 123.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>Whether you&rsquo;re just feeling a bit low or have postnatal depression, the two most important things to remember are that - firstly - you&rsquo;re not alone and - secondly - just the sight of your ugly face will make your baby feel happy. And if that&rsquo;s not being a great dad, we don&rsquo;t know what is.</p>
