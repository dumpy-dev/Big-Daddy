<p>Postnatal depression is one of those things that no one really talks about, but it&rsquo;s actually very common. In fact, by the time it&rsquo;s their child&rsquo;s first birthday, more than 1 in 10 mothers will have suffered from postnatal depression.</p>
<p>During the first couple of weeks after the baby is born, (mother) might cry quite a bit, or be more anxious than usual. Don&rsquo;t be alarmed. These so-called &ldquo;baby blues&rdquo; are so incredibly common that they&rsquo;re actually normal. To be fair, she&rsquo;s just given birth and had to instantly adjust to a strange new world which probably involves very little sleep and very leaky boobs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>If she&rsquo;s feeling tearful, put the kettle on and ask her what would help her feel happier. Why not unload the dishwasher, change the sheets and take the baby out on a walk so she can have a good nap. If you&rsquo;re bottle feeding, why not suggest that you do all the feeds for a night or two to help her get a bit of rest. Or if she&rsquo;s breastfeeding, get up with her to keep her company. With a bit of rest and TLC, chances are the baby blues will clear up in a week or two.</p>
<p>But for some women, the baby blues can turn into postnatal depression. Other women might feel absolutely fine until they start feeling not-so-fine a few months down the line. Either way, postnatal depression usually develops gradually, so some women don&rsquo;t even realise that there&rsquo;s anything wrong. This is where you come in.</p>
<p>Here are some of the symptoms of postnatal depression:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>persistently feeling sad or low</li>
                <li>finding it hard to bond with the baby</li>
                <li>not being interested in life</li>
                <li>not wanting to get in touch with friends or family</li>
                <li>not enjoying life like she used to</li>
                <li>feeling sleepy in the day, but having difficulty sleeping at night</li>
                <li>finding it hard to concentrate or make decisions</li>
                <li>having scary thoughts (such as wanting to harm the baby)</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>If you notice that (mother) has any of these symptoms, you should encourage her to speak to her GP straight away. It&rsquo;s really important that she gets the help she needs, as postnatal depression is just as serious as other types of depression and can last for months if left untreated. If getting a good night&rsquo;s sleep and spending time with family and friends doesn&rsquo;t help, she might be offered therapy or antidepressants.</p>
            <p>Whether (mother) develops postnatal depression or not, make sure she knows that she&rsquo;s an amazing mother. Having a baby is a life changing event - it can be stressful and exhausting, so there&rsquo;s absolutely nothing to be ashamed of if she does develop postnatal depression. Most importantly, make sure she knows that having postnatal depression doesn&rsquo;t mean that she&rsquo;s going mad or that her baby will be taken away from her (this only happens in very exceptional circumstances).</p>
            <p>Did you know that postnatal depression also affects up to 1 in 10 new fathers too? Have a read of our Postnatal Depression in Dads article to find out more.</p>
