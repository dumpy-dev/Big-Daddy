            <p>Pre-eclampsia is a medical condition which causes high blood pressure. It affects around 6% of pregnant women. In most cases, it is quite mild. However, in around 1-2% of pregnancies, severe pre-eclampsia (which is a serious health risk to the mother and baby) can develop.</p>
            <p>Pre-eclampsia is usually picked up during a routine antenatal appointment, typically after 24-26 weeks, where the mother has:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>high blood pressure; and</li>
                <li>protein in her urine (proteinuria)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Lots of women have either high blood pressure or proteinuria, so it usually only indicates pre-eclampsia if both of these are found at the same time.</p>
            <p>As the pregnancy progresses, some women with pre-eclampsia may develop other symptoms, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>severe headaches</li>
                <li>swollen face, ankles, feet or hands</li>
                <li>blurred vision or (seeing) flashing lights</li>
                <li>severe heartburn</li>
                <li>nausea or vomiting</li>
                <li>pain below the ribs</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If (mother) has any of the above symptoms, she should call her GP straight away, even if she hasn&rsquo;t had a pre-eclampsia diagnosis.</p>
            <p>Pre-eclampsia can cause the baby to grow more slowly than expected, as it&rsquo;s not getting a good enough blood supply through the placenta.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>Where untreated, pre-eclampsia can be very dangerous. In rare cases, it can lead to eclampsia (fitting or convulsions), something called HELLP syndrome or even a stroke.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, there is no cure for pre-eclampsia apart from delivering the baby. Women with pre-eclampsia are usually admitted to hospital for constant monitoring until the baby can be delivered (usually via induction or caesarian section) around 37 weeks. If the mum&rsquo;s symptoms get worse before 37 weeks, the baby may need to be delivered early.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>Once the baby is born, the mum&rsquo;s pre-eclampsia usually gets better. However, both mum and baby usually need to stay in hospital for a few days after delivery for monitoring, and the mum will need to take medication to lower her blood pressure for a few weeks.</p>
            <p>Nobody really knows what causes pre-eclampsia, but 1 in 6 women who have had pre-eclampsia will develop it again in a future pregnancy. If (mother) is diagnosed with pre-eclampsia, try not to worry. She - and (the baby) - will be monitored closely and will be in safe hands.</p>
