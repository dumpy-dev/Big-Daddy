            <p>Around 8 in every 100 babies arrive before 37 weeks. This means that some premature babies are only a few weeks early, where others can be born as early as 24 weeks. If you&rsquo;re having twins, the average delivery date is 37 weeks. If it&rsquo;s triplets, the average is 33 weeks.</p>
            <p>Almost half of premature (or pre-term) babies are deliberately brought into the world early - either through an induction of labour or c-section - because of pregnancy complications (such as pre-eclampsia) or if the baby isn&rsquo;t growing properly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>If (mother) feels contractions or her waters break before 37 weeks, she&rsquo;ll need to call her midwife straight away. In unusual cases, waters can break with no sign of labour starting. This is called pre-term pre-labour rupture of membranes (or P-PROM). If this happens, there is a risk of infection. (mother) will need to stay in hospital for a couple of days, but if labour doesn&rsquo;t start then she may be able to go home with antibiotics (and a thermometer) to ward off infection. If labour doesn&rsquo;t start within ten days, the baby may have to be delivered early.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>Labour before 37 weeks is often quicker than full-term labour. However, babies born early are at a higher risk of having developmental problems.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>If she goes into labour before 36 weeks, (mother) may be offered corticosteroid injections to help the baby&rsquo;s lungs get ready to breathe. If labour starts before 29 weeks, (mother) should also be offered magnesium sulphate to protect the baby&rsquo;s brain development.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>If your baby is born early, they may need to be seen by the medical team immediately. This means that you may not be able to hold them straight away. If this happens, you mustn&rsquo;t panic. (mother) will have just given birth and will need you to stay calm. You can reassure her by holding her hand and telling her what an amazing job she&rsquo;s done. If you&rsquo;re worried about what&rsquo;s going on with your baby, ask a midwife to explain what&rsquo;s happening.</p>
            <p>Premature babies often need to spend some time in a (very warm) neonatal unit, and may even be in an incubator for a while. If they&rsquo;re more than a few weeks early, your baby may look a little different to other newborns. Their skin may be red and be covered with downy hair (lanugo). Don&rsquo;t worry - over time, they&rsquo;ll put on weight and look just like other babies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>The first few days or weeks of life with a premature baby can be a really emotional time for parents, and you&rsquo;ll need to make sure that you&rsquo;re as supportive a partner as you can be.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>It can be a bit unsettling to see your baby in this environment, but it&rsquo;s the best way to make sure that they can continue to develop outside of the womb.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>If your baby is born early, Tommy&rsquo;s has a brilliant website with loads of information on premature births: https://www.tommys.org/pregnancy-information/pregnancy-complications/premature-birth-information-and-support<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
