            <p>Let&rsquo;s talk about sex, baby!<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>If she&rsquo;s feeling nauseous, tired, cranky or self-conscious about her changing shape, (mother) may have temporarily lost that loving feeling. But for some women, being pregnant may increase their sex drive. But is it safe to have sex while pregnant? Couldn&rsquo;t it squish the baby? Will all that jiggling make the baby fall out?</p>
            <p>Fortunately, if there haven&rsquo;t been any complications, sex during pregnancy is completely safe. There&rsquo;s absolutely no way any penis is big enough to reach the baby, and having sex won&rsquo;t upset the baby or cause a miscarriage or early labour.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>The only time that sex might not be safe is if the woman has had heavy bleeding during her pregnancy or if her waters have broken. If this is the case, her midwife or doctor will advise whether sex is safe.</p>
            <p>Nearer the end of her pregnancy, having sex might cause (mother) to have Braxton Hicks (practice) contractions. These are completely harmless and nothing to worry about. Although there&rsquo;s absolutely no scientific evidence to back it up, some people think that having sex once the baby is due releases happy hormones which can help trigger labour. So if those practice contractions are more intense or regular than expected, do call a midwife for advice.</p>
            <p>Having sex with your pregnant partner can feel a little like trying to do gymnastics with a beach ball balancing between the two of you. You might have to get a little creative, but if the two of you are in the mood, having sex can be a great way to relax and enjoy some time together before the world&rsquo;s greatest contraceptive arrives.</p>
