            <p>The hospital bag is packed, the cot is assembled (after a minor argument over some missing screws and only a few tears), and the bump is BIG. But how do you know when it&rsquo;s all about to kick off?</p>
            <p>To help prepare you for that oh-my-god-we&rsquo;re-having-a-baby-actually-right-now-and-I&rsquo;m-a-bit-scared moment, here&rsquo;s a list of signs and symptoms that labour is on the way. Don&rsquo;t forget that every woman is different, and (mother) may end up having all, some or none of these symptoms.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>waters breaking. This may happen in a gush in the frozen vegetable aisle in Sainsbury&rsquo;s, or it might just be a slow trickle over a few hours. If she suspects her waters have broken, (mother) should call her maternity unit right away. It may be that (mother)&rsquo;s waters don&rsquo;t break until she&rsquo;s about to give birth. Occasionally, the baby is born with the amniotic sac intact - this is called being born &ldquo;en caul&rdquo; and is very rare.</li>
                <li>contractions starting. If it&rsquo;s labour for real (rather than those pesky Braxton Hicks), the contractions will be painful and increase in intensity, although they might still stop and start a little. You might find it helpful to use our contraction timer to keep track of contractions.</li>
                <li>persistent lower back pain or tummy cramps</li>
                <li>a brownish or blood-tinged mucus discharge<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></li>
                <li>a funny tummy</li>
                <li>disrupted sleep</li>
            </ul>
            <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
            <p>As a general rule, midwives like you to come in once the contractions are painful and happening at least every five minutes, with each one lasting at least a minute. However, each midwife unit or hospital will have its own set of rules, so it&rsquo;s important for you or (mother) to call in once you think labour is starting (or if her waters have broken) and they will be able to give you advice on what to do next.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>Once you get the go ahead, leave the house and take the cannoli! Or jelly babies, if you prefer. It&rsquo;s nearly time to say hello to your little friend!</p>
