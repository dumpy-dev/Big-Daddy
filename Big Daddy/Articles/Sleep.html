            <p>Did you know that - on average - new parents miss out on 44 days of sleep within the first year of their child&rsquo;s life? It&rsquo;s time to make the most of those early nights and long lie-ins before your little bundle of sleepless joy arrives.</p>
            <p>But in a cruel twist of fate, pregnant women often find themselves suffering from sleepless or restless nights. If (mother) is finding it hard to catch up on z&rsquo;s, she can try these tips:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>drink a cup of herbal tea (such as camomile) around an hour before bedtime. Try and avoid caffeinated drinks in the evenings.</li>
                <li>run a warm (not hot) bath in the evening and add a few drops of lavender essential oil or (mother)&rsquo;s favourite bubble bath. Light some candles and put on some relaxing music.</li>
                <li>don&rsquo;t eat dinner too late, as our bodies need time to digest the food before sleep.</li>
                <li>keep the lights in your bedroom dim, and ban all electronics from the room. No late night googling allowed. You&rsquo;ll do enough of that when baby has arrived.</li>
                <li>do some gentle yoga or breathing and relaxation exercises.</li>
                <li>try and go to sleep before 11pm, as we usually get our best quality sleep before midnight.</li>
                <li>if (mother)&rsquo;s bump is making her uncomfortable, try placing pillows around her for support.</li>
                <li>if all else fails, sex releases happy hormones and can be a great way to relax.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Once (mother) reaches 16 weeks of pregnancy, it&rsquo;s really important that she doesn&rsquo;t sleep on her back - even if that&rsquo;s how she always slept before she was pregnant. Research has shown that if pregnant women go to sleep on their backs during their third trimester, the risk of stillbirth increases. If (mother) wakes up in the night and finds that she has rolled onto her back, there&rsquo;s no need to panic - she should just turn back onto her side again. It&rsquo;s still a very low risk overall (around 1 in 200), but sleeping on her side will lower this risk even further.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
