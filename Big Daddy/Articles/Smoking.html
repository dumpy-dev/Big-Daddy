            <p>Babies, eh? They may take our lives but they&rsquo;ll never take our fags! Actually, that&rsquo;s a lie. They&rsquo;ll take both.</p>
            <p>Smoking during pregnancy is dangerous for both mother and baby. Not only does one cigarette contain over 4,000 potentially harmful chemicals, but it also reduces the amount of oxygen which reaches your baby. This means that the baby&rsquo;s heart has to work harder to get vital oxygen around its body. Scientists have even found that, within five minutes of a pregnant woman starting to smoke a cigarette, the number of breathing movements that her baby was practising was reduced.</p>
            <p>And if this wasn&rsquo;t enough, smoking during pregnancy also increases the risk of:</p>
            <ul>
                    <li>stillbirth<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></li>
                    <li>complications during pregnancy and labour</li>
                    <li>baby being born prematurely</li>
                    <li>baby being underweight</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Stopping smoking at any stage of pregnancy - even if it&rsquo;s in the last few weeks - will be really beneficial to both mother and baby. If your partner is struggling to give up, her GP may be able to prescribe Nicotine Replacement Therapy patches, gum or sprays to help. She shouldn&rsquo;t take stop smoking tablets (such as Champix or Zyban) or liquorice-flavoured products, as these could be harmful to the baby.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>Secondhand smoke also increases the risk that your baby will be underweight, as well as the risk of cot death and chest infections during their first year. So if you&rsquo;re a smoker, it&rsquo;s also time for you to bin the fags.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>The jury is still out on vaping during pregnancy, but it&rsquo;s thought to be less harmful than smoking cigarettes. E-cigarettes do still contain some potentially harmful chemicals, but at a much lower level than cigarettes.</p>
            <p>It&rsquo;s incredibly hard to give up smoking, but having a baby might just be the push that you or your partner needs. If either of you need help giving up, the NHS has a brilliant helpline: 0300 123 1044.</p>
