            <p>If you&rsquo;re starting to feel anxious about becoming a father, don&rsquo;t worry - most men feel the same way. To reassure you, we&rsquo;ve listed the most common new dad worries. (If you&rsquo;re not feeling anxious, don&rsquo;t read this article. We don&rsquo;t want to worry you about being worried.)</p>
            <ol>
            <li><b>What if something goes wrong during the birth, or afterwards?</b></li>
            </ol>
            <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
            <p>It&rsquo;s normal to worry about the &ldquo;what ifs&rdquo;, but try to think about the probabilities not possibilities. Of course there&rsquo;s always a small chance of things going wrong, but there&rsquo;s also a small chance of you becoming the next Pope and we all know that&rsquo;s probably not going to happen. Instead, try and focus on the things you can control, such as supporting (mother) through the birth and making sure that your home is ready for your new family member. If you&rsquo;re really worried, do speak to (mother)&rsquo;s midwife or GP about your concerns.</p>
            <ol start="2">
                <li><b>How the hell are we going to look after a tiny human?</b></li>
            </ol>
            <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
            <p>Definitely the most common worry. But pretty much every new parent is in the same boat. All you need to remember is to make sure the baby is fed, warm, clean and comforted. You&rsquo;ll feel like you have no idea what you&rsquo;re doing until, one day, you&rsquo;ll realise that you&rsquo;ve found your groove. And at the end of the day if Three Men can look after a baby, so can you.</p>
            <ol start="3">
                <li><b>What if I can&rsquo;t stop the baby crying?</b></li>
            </ol>
            <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
            <p>All babies cry - it&rsquo;s a fact of life, and it doesn&rsquo;t make you a bad parent. If your baby is crying, try feeding them, winding them, changing their nappy, and making sure that they&rsquo;re not too hot or too cold. If they&rsquo;re still crying, just put some earplugs in and give them a cuddle or a gentle rock. Some babies cry way more than others, but if you&rsquo;re ever worried about it, talk to a health professional.</p>
            <ol start="4">
                <li><b>What if I drop the baby?</b></li>
            </ol>
            <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
            <p>Yeah, definitely try not to drop the baby. Don&rsquo;t forget that newborn babies can&rsquo;t hold their heads up, so you&rsquo;ll need to support their neck for at least the first month or so. If you&rsquo;re really worried about dropping the baby, you can practise holding them while sitting down to start with. You&rsquo;ll get used to it before you know it, and before long your fragile newborn will be a bouncing baby who loves playing rough and tumble with you.</p>
            <ol start="5">
                <li><b>My life as a dad is going to be way less fun, and will definitely involve fewer pints and pubs.</b></li>
            </ol>
            <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
            <p>We&rsquo;re not going to lie - your life will change when you have a baby. And there may well be fewer lads&rsquo; nights out. But that doesn&rsquo;t have to mean neither of you will ever go out again. Why not take the baby along with you to the local? Or suggest to (mother) that you stay home on daddy-duty while she goes out with her friends, and ask if she&rsquo;d mind doing the same thing for you. And perhaps there&rsquo;s a willing friend or relative who might babysit while you and (mother) go on a well-earned date. Together, you&rsquo;ll make it work.</p>
            <ol start="6">
                <li><b>What if the baby doesn&rsquo;t sleep? I am so cranky when I&rsquo;m sleep deprived. Scratch that, (mother) is SO CRANKY when she&rsquo;s sleep deprived.</b></li>
            </ol>
            <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
            <p>On average, new parents lose 44 days of sleep during the first year of their child&rsquo;s life. And in the early days, your baby is going to need feeding every three hours, around the clock.</p>
            <p>Unless you&rsquo;re sleeping in a separate room to both (mother) and the baby, there will be times when you&rsquo;ll wonder if you&rsquo;ve turned into Tyler Durden. Try not to take your tiredness out on (mother), and be understanding if she&rsquo;s grumpier than usual. After all, sleep deprivation is a form of torture. Remind yourself that the baby will, one day, learn to sleep. Then, you will sleep again. And in the meantime, have some caffeine and draft in willing friends or relatives to watch the baby while you and (mother) nap.</p>
            <p>On a side note, you may hear people tell (mother) to &ldquo;sleep when the baby sleeps&rdquo;. This is lovely, very well-intentioned advice, probably thought of by someone who has never had a baby. Or has never needed a shower. Or to eat. Or to have a cup of tea.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <ol start="7">
                <li><b>Can we really afford to have a baby?</b></li>
            </ol>
            <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
            <p>There&rsquo;s no getting away from it - babies are expensive. But there are plenty of ways to keep the costs of having a baby down, from buying secondhand clothes and toys in charity shops and online, to shopping in bulk for nappies and wipes. Make sure you have a look at the government&rsquo;s website to see if you will qualify for any financial assistance, and make a household budget to try and plan ahead.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <ol start="8">
                <li><b>Am I ready to be a dad?</b></li>
            </ol>
            <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
            <p>Chances are, you don&rsquo;t feel ready to be a dad. There&rsquo;s something about becoming a dad that makes you feel a ton of pressure about providing for your new family. But try not to worry - most men don&rsquo;t feel ready to become a dad. And if you really are worrying, talk to (mother) or other dads you know about how you&rsquo;re feeling.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <ol start="9">
                <li><b>What if I don&rsquo;t love my baby right away?</b></li>
            </ol>
            <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
            <p>This one is a bit of a taboo, but not all parents fall in love with their baby right away. In the movies, dads instantly feel a surge of love when they first hold their newborn baby. But in real life, it doesn&rsquo;t always happen like that. So don&rsquo;t feel bad about it if you look at your baby and wonder why you&rsquo;re not crying tears of happiness. You might love your baby from the moment you set eyes on their bawling face. Or it might take a few weeks. Or even longer. But one day, you&rsquo;ll realise that you can&rsquo;t imagine life without your little poonami-monster.</p>
            <ol start="10">
                <li><b>What if I&rsquo;m a rubbish dad?</b></li>
            </ol>
            <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
            <p>If you don&rsquo;t want to be a rubbish dad, you won&rsquo;t be. Sure, you&rsquo;ll make mistakes along the way. But you can be whatever type of dad you want to be. And just by worrying about whether you&rsquo;ll be a good dad, you&rsquo;re already on the way to being a pretty brilliant one.</p>
