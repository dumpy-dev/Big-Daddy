            <p>Preparation is key. Here&rsquo;s our handy list of things to do before B-Day.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Make sure the hospital bag is packed and ready to go from around 36 weeks. If there are things that you&rsquo;ll need to chuck in at the last minute (such as toothbrushes or phone chargers), keep a handy list in the bag so you can check those things off at the last minute. Have a look at our hospital bag checklist!</li>
                <li>Try and pack the hospital bag yourself (under (mother)&rsquo;s close supervision). Trust us, it helps if you know the difference between a maternity pad and a breast pad in the heat of the moment.</li>
                <li>Construct the cot, crib or moses basket - whatever the baby is going to be sleeping in. Work out how long you think it&rsquo;s going to take you, then double it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></li>
                <li>If you can, get batch cooking and freeze some meals in advance. If you&rsquo;re more Gordon Brown than Gordon Ramsay, find some tasty and healthy meals in the supermarket to keep in the freezer. You&rsquo;ll thank us when you&rsquo;ve changed your 23rd nappy of the day and feel ready to drop.</li>
                <li>Do an online shop, but keep all the items in your basket and ready to check out. Make sure you&rsquo;ve chosen plenty of tea bags, coffee and snacks. Then, when B-day comes around, you can schedule the delivery for when you know you&rsquo;ll be home.</li>
                <li>Make sure you have plenty of nappies!</li>
                <li>Search YouTube for tutorials on how to give really good shoulder, back, hand and foot massages. Ask (mother) if she&rsquo;d like a massage, and practise your new skills.</li>
                <li>If (mother) has any birth preferences, try and talk them through with her. Does she want to have an epidural, or would she find a water bath helpful? Make sure you know how she feels so that you can help speak for her during labour.</li>
                <li>Put important numbers - the hospital or midwife unit, and her family&rsquo;s contact details - onto your phone in advance. Perhaps also write them on a piece of paper and pack in the hospital bag, just in case.</li>
                <li>If you&rsquo;re planning on driving to a hospital or maternity unit to have the baby, do a recce to make sure you know where you&rsquo;re going and where to park. If the parking machine only takes change, make sure you pack some cash in the hospital bag.</li>
                <li>If you have a car, make sure the car seat is fitted and you know how to get it in and out easily. And while you&rsquo;re there, check there&rsquo;s plenty of fuel in the tank.</li>
