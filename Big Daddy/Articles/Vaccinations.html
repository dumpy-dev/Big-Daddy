            <p>In the UK, all pregnant women will be offered the following vaccinations on the NHS:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Flu jab (usually during the winter months from around September to January)</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <p>(mother) should make sure she has this jab as pregnant women are more likely to develop complications (such as bronchitis, or even pneumonia) from flu, which can lead to complications with the baby. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <ol start="2">
                <li>Whooping cough (ideally between 16 and 32 weeks)</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <p>The whooping cough vaccination is actually given to protect the baby, not the mother. The immunity is passed from the mother to the baby through the placenta, and will protect the baby until they have their own whooping cough vaccination when they&rsquo;re a couple of months old. In severe cases, whooping cough can cause death in young babies, so it&rsquo;s really important that (mother) gets the jab.</p>
            <p>Both vaccinations are completely safe during pregnancy, and can even be given in the same appointment. (mother) may have a bit of a sore arm after the jabs, and might feel a little bit under the weather after the flu jab in particular, but it won&rsquo;t last long.</p>
            <p>If (mother) has a rhesus negative blood type (e.g. O- or A-), she will also need an injection of anti-D at 28 weeks. Have a read of our blood groups article for more details.</p>
