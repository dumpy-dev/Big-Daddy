            <p>There are two crucial vitamin supplements which (mother) should be taking during pregnancy. If she&rsquo;s not taking them, it&rsquo;s your job to remind her.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Folic acid - (mother) needs to take 400 micrograms of folic acid per day until she is 12 weeks pregnant to help prevent birth defects such as spina bifida. Ideally, (mother) should also take folic acid whilst trying to conceive, but don&rsquo;t stress if this didn&rsquo;t happen. The most important thing is that she takes it regularly throughout the first three months of pregnancy.</li>
                <li>Vitamin D - (mother) should also take 10 micrograms of vitamin D per day throughout her pregnancy, and after the birth if she decides to breastfeed. Vitamin D helps to maintain healthy bones, teeth and muscles. In fact, if you live in a country such as the UK where there is disappointingly little sunshine, it&rsquo;s recommended that everyone takes a vitamin D supplement in the winter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Whatever you do, don&rsquo;t let (mother) take any supplement containing vitamin A as it could be harmful for the baby.</p>
            <p>It&rsquo;s also important that (mother) gets plenty of vitamin C, iron and calcium throughout her pregnancy. She may prefer to get these through her diet, or she can buy special pregnancy multivitamins which contain all the important supplements for pregnancy (and don&rsquo;t contain vitamin A).<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p>If you&rsquo;re feeling the Jamie Oliver vibe (or you&rsquo;re trying to make amends for leaving your smelly football boots in the bedroom), you could even make her a nutritious meal or snack.</p>
