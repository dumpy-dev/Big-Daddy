                    Around now, \(mother) might start feeling a bit breathless. During her pregnancy, \(mother)âs ribcage has been moving outwards and her body has been working more quickly to process the oxygen and carbon dioxide in each breath. This means that sheâs able to take much deeper breaths, but also might make her feel a bit breathless sometimes. And as the baby gets bigger, they will be pushing up against \(mother)âs lungs, which will make her feel even more breathless. Itâs usually nothing to worry about, but if \(mother) is also getting palpitations or dizziness, she should contact her GP.
                    
                    So donât laugh at \(mother) next time you beat her when racing up the stairs to go to the toilet. Be a gentleman and let her go first.

These little tightenings of her bump are called Braxton Hicks contractions, and theyâre bigger fakers than Trumanâs neighbours on Seahaven Island. Unless they start increasing in intensity, or donât ease off after a short while, Braxton Hicks contractions are just a way of \(mother)âs body preparing itself for labour.
                    
                    With her ever-growing bump and the return of the mid-night loo trips, \(mother) might be finding it harder to sleep than Al Pacino in Alaska. She might also report having some crazy dreams around now. Whatever she tells you, just nod. And donât take it personally if she dreams that the baby comes out looking like Bob in Accounts.

If you want to earn Dad points, why not make her favourite meal (or order a takeaway) and give her sole access to the remote for an evening?

                    As the baby gets bigger, the movements will feel different. However, \(mother) should be keeping track of the babyâs usual movements, and should let the midwife know straight away if she thinks the movements have become less frequent.

In the heat of labour, youâll be the one searching through the bag so itâs a great way to make sure you know your maternity pads from your breast pads. As it were.
